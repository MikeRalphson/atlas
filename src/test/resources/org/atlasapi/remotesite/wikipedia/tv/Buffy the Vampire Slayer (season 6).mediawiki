== Plot ==
At the beginning of season six [[Willow Rosenberg|Willow]] resurrects [[Buffy Summers|Buffy]] with a powerful spell. Although her friends believe that they have taken her out of [[Hell]], Buffy had actually been in [[Heaven]] since her death (a fact that is revealed to her friends later in the season). She is therefore traumatized by her resurrection and this causes her to fall into a deep depression for most of the season. 

[[Rupert Giles|Giles]] returns to England after realizing that Buffy has become too reliant on him, while Buffy takes up a fast-food job for money and develops a secret, mutually abusive relationship with [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]].

[[Dawn Summers|Dawn]] is happy to have her sister back, but Buffy's depression causes Dawn's feelings of alienation to lead to [[kleptomania]].  When a demon briefly traps everyone in the Summers' house, Dawn's feelings are revealed and Buffy promises to help mend their relationship and spend more time together.

On the wedding day of [[Xander Harris|Xander]] and [[Anya Jenkins|Anya]], a magician, seeking his own vengeance against Anya, tricks Xander into calling off the wedding by showing him a future where they are both miserable. Anya reverts to a [[vengeance demon]] once more. When Anya can't find anyone who wishes vengeance on Xander, she has a [[one night stand]] with Spike, endangering Spike's relationship with Buffy.

Willow becomes addicted to magic. [[Tara Maclay|Tara]] becomes concerned and challenges Willow to go a week without magic, but Willow gives in to her addiction, causing Tara to leave her. Despite their separation, Tara is still devoted to helping Willow with her addiction, leading to their reconciliation.

They also begin to deal with [[Trio (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Trio]], a group of nerds led by [[Warren Mears]] who use their technological and magical proficiency to attempt to kill or neutralize Buffy and take over [[Sunnydale]], a goal they had in mind since the beginning of the season. The Trio would often use monsters such as vampires and demons to assist them. 

Warren is shown to be the only competent villain of the group, and his capacity for evil is demonstrated by the attempted rape of his ex-girlfriend, which leads to her death. After Buffy thwarts his plans multiple times and the Trio breaks apart, Warren then attacks Buffy with a gun but accidentally kills Tara with a stray bullet. Willow tries to resurrect Tara but fails.

Tara's death causes Willow to descend into darkness and unleash all of her dark magical powers. Willow hunts down and flays Warren alive in vengeance. Driven by grief, Willow fights and overpowers Buffy, who is forced to fight when she is unable to condone Willow's actions. Giles returns to help face Willow in battle and infuses her with light magic, tapping into her remaining humanity. This backfires when Willow feels pain in everyone around the world and decides to destroy the world in order to end everyone's suffering. At the climax of the season, Xander prevents Willow from destroying the world by continually telling her he loves her. She eventually breaks down, and the dark magic drains from her. Meanwhile, Buffy comes to terms with being alive again, and promises to be there for her friends.

At the end of the season, after attacking and attempting to rape Buffy, Spike leaves Sunnydale and travels to Africa to see a demon and asks him to "make him to what he used to be" so that he can "give Buffy what she deserves." The audience is led to believe that he was referring to the freedom to be evil (unrestrained by his punishment chip) and thus able to kill Buffy; however, after passing a series of tests, Spike is rewarded with the restoration of his soul.

=== Crossovers with ''Angel'' ===
The sixth season of ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' coincided with the [[Angel (season 3)|third season]] of ''[[Angel (TV series)|Angel]]''. With this season, ''Buffy'' switched networks from [[The WB Television Network|The WB]] to [[UPN]], while ''Angel'' still remained on The WB. Because they were on competing networks, there were no official crossovers. At the time, WB Entertainment President Jordan Levin stated "There will be no crossovers between ''Angel'' and ''Buffy''. I think it's more important, in the long term, that ''Angel'' really establishes itself as a world that obviously comes from the same mythology, but operates with its own set of principles, guidelines and characters, and really establishes itself independently from ''Buffy''."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/joss-whedon-talks-angelbuffy-crossovers_article_27874.html|title=Joss Whedon Talks Angel/Buffy Crossovers|author=Frank Kurtz|work=Mania.com|date=July 16, 2001|accessdate=August 1, 2010}}</ref> Although there are no distinct crossovers where characters appear on the other shows, there are moments where characters are mentioned or moments that happen off screen.

At the end of the ''Angel'' episode "[[Carpe Noctem (Angel)|Carpe Noctem]]", [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] ([[David Boreanaz]]) receives a telephone call in which [[Willow Rosenberg|Willow]] tells him [[Buffy Summers|Buffy]] is alive. Buffy then receives a call from Angel at the end of "[[Flooded (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Flooded]]", and immediately leaves to meet with him. Although the phone call scenes happen on screen, neither Willow's side on ''Angel'' nor Angel's side on ''Buffy'' is shown. The scene between Buffy and Angel also happens off screen, but is described by them in the following episodesIterator.

Due to the crossover embargo, this is the only season of ''Buffy'' in which Angel does not appear.

== Reception ==
The series received four [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations, for Outstanding Hairstyling for a Series, Outstanding Makeup for a Series (Non-Prosthetic), and Outstanding Makeup for a Series (Prosthetic) for "[[Hell's Bells (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Hell's Bells]]"; and Outstanding Music Direction for "[[Once More, with Feeling (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Once More, with Feeling]]".

[[Sarah Michelle Gellar]], [[Alyson Hannigan]], [[James Marsters]], and [[Emma Caulfield]] were nominated for [[Satellite Award]]s for their performances.

The cast won a Special Achievement Award for Outstanding Television Ensemble at the [[Satellite Award]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118276/awards|title="Buffy the Vampire Slayer" (1997) - Awards|work=[[IMDb]]|accessdate=August 2, 2010}}</ref>

"Once More, with Feeling" was nominated for a [[Hugo Award]] for [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation|Best Dramatic Presentation]] and for a [[Nebula Award]] for [[Nebula Award for Best Script|Best Script]].

"Once More, with Feeling" received positive praise from media and critics when it aired, during overseas syndication, and in reminiscences of the best episodesIterator of ''Buffy'' after the series ended. Although [[Salon.com]] writer [[Stephanie Zacharek]] states "(t)he songs were only half-memorable at best, and the singing ability of the show's regular cast ranged only from the fairly good to the not so great", she also asserts that it works "beautifully", paces itself gracefully, and is "clever and affecting".<ref>Zacharek, Stephanie (November 7, 2001). "[http://www.salon.com/entertainment/tv/feature/2001/11/07/buffy_musical/index1.html The Hills Are Alive with the Sound of&nbsp;... Vampire Slaying!]", Salon.com. Retrieved on June 7, 2010.</ref> Tony Johnston in the ''[[Herald Sun]]'' writes that Gellar "struggles on some of her higher notes, but her dance routines are superb, Michelle Trachtenberg's Dawn reveals sensual dance moves way beyond her tender years, and James Marsters' Spike evokes a sort of Billy Idol yell to disguise his lack of vocal proficiency&nbsp;[...] The rest of the cast mix and match like ready-made Broadway troupers." Johnston counts "I'll Never Tell" as one of the episode's "standout moments".<ref>Johnston, Tony (April 14, 2002). "Something to Sing About", ''The Sunday Herald Sun'' (Melbourne, Australia), p. X06.</ref> Connie Ogle in ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' calls the songs "better and far more clever than most of the ones you'll hear on Broadway these days".<ref>Ogle, Connie (July 23, 2002). "Something's Fangtastically Wrong in Emmyland", ''The Miami Herald'', p. 1E.</ref>

Writers agree that the episode was risky and could have failed spectacularly. Jonathan Bernstein in the British newspaper ''[[The Observer]]'' writes "What could have been, at best, an eccentric diversion and, at worst, a shuddering embarrassment, succeeded on every level&nbsp;[...]  It provided a startling demonstration that creator Joss Whedon has a facility with lyrics and melody equal to the one he's demonstrated for the past six seasons with dialogue, character and plot twists. Rather than adopt the 'Hey, wouldn't it be wacky if we suddenly burst into song?' approach practiced by ''[[Ally McBeal]]'', the ''Buffy'' musical was entirely organic to the series' labyrinthine progression." <ref>Bernstein, Jonathan (November 17, 2001). "The Guide: Aerial view of America", ''The Observer'', p. 98.</ref> Steve Murray in ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' characterizes the episode as "scary in a brand-new way", saying "Once More, with Feeling" is "as impressive as Whedon's milestone episodesIterator 'Hush' and 'The Body{{'"}}; the episode is "often hilarious", according to Murray, and acts as "(b)oth spoof and homage, [parodying] the hokiness of musicals while also capturing the guilty pleasure and surges of feeling the genre inspires".<ref>Murray, Steve (November 6, 2001). "' Buffy ' and friends fight fiend with a song in their heart", ''Atlanta Journal-Constitution'', p. C3.</ref>

Scott Feschuk in Canada's ''[[National Post]]'' states that the episode "conveyed the same sense of rampant, runaway genius—the rare fusion of artful storytelling and ardent entertainment, a production capable of moving viewers to tears or to an awestruck rapture".<ref>Feschuk, Scott (July 10, 2002). "Genius without breaking a sweat: The best TV shows understand that brilliance should seem effortless", ''National Post'' (Canada), p. AL1.</ref> Writing in the ''[[Toronto Star]]'', Vinay Menon calls "Once More, with Feeling" "dazzling" and writes of "Joss Whedon's inimitable genius"; he goes on to say "(f)or a show that already violates conventions and morphs between genres, its allegorical narrative zigging and zagging seamlessly across chatty comedy, drama and over-the-top horror, 'Once More, with Feeling' is a towering achievement&nbsp;[...] The show may be anchored by existential weightiness, it may be painted with broad, supernatural brushstrokes, but in the end, this coming-of-age story, filled with angst and alienation, is more real than any other so-called teen drama&nbsp;[...] So let's add another line of gushing praise: 'Once More, with Feeling' is rhapsodic, original, deeply affecting, and ultimately, transcendental. Quite simply, television at its best."<ref>Menon, Vinay (November 13, 2002). "Brilliant Buffy still slays us", ''The Toronto Star'', p. D01.</ref>
