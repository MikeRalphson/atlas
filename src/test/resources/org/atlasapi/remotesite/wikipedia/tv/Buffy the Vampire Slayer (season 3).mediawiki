==Plot==
After attempting to [[Anne (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|start a new life]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[Buffy Summers]] ([[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]) returns to [[Sunnydale]] in season three, and is reunited with her friends and her mother. Her criminal record is cleared but Principal Snyder, who took a vindictive pleasure in expelling Buffy refuses to have her reinstated, until he is told down by Giles. [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] ([[David Boreanaz]]) is resurrected due to unknown circumstances. While Buffy is happy to have Angel back, he seems to have lost much of his sanity in Hell. Buffy helps Angel recover but, having seen Angel's demonic side, Buffy's friends distrust him until he saves them from a monster.

[[Rupert Giles]] ([[Anthony Head|Anthony Stewart Head]]) is fired from the [[Watchers' Council]] because he has developed a "father's love" for Buffy, and towards the end of the season Buffy announces that she will also no longer work for the Council. Early in the season she is confronted with an unstable [[Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Slayer]], [[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]] ([[Eliza Dushku]]), who was activated after Kendra's death near the end of season two.

Angel, after getting his soul back, is once again tormented by his guilt and personally by an entity called the [[First Evil]], who goads Angel into attempting suicide. Buffy prevents Angel from killing himself but he still feels heavy remorse for his past actions.  

Although the First is still out there, the antagonist of the season is shown to be the affable Mayor [[Mayor (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Richard Wilkins]] ([[Harry Groener]]), who has plans to become an Olvikan, a giant snake-like demon, on Sunnydale High's Graduation Day — a goal he had in mind after gaining immortality through a Faustian bargain with demons when he originally founded Sunnydale. Said goal is to occur on the eclipse, where the Mayor has vampire lackey's backing him up.

Although Faith works with Buffy at first, after [[Bad Girls (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|accidentally killing a human]], Faith becomes irrational and sides with Mayor Wilkins, whose charismatic behavior influences Faith's dark side. She helps Wilkins in his plan, and eventually she poisons Angel. To save Angel, Buffy had to feed him the blood of a Slayer, so she picks Faith. In the fight that follows, Faith falls from her roof and into coma. Buffy is forced to let Angel drink from her, putting her in a brief coma. Wilkins, who had a fatherly affection for Faith gets angry and attempts to suffocate her, but is stopped by Angel. During her time in a coma, Buffy shares a comatose dream with Faith where they make peace.

At the climax of the season, Wilkins speaks at the graduation ceremony, as the time for his transformation has come and he finally morphs into Olvikan. He kills several people, including [[Principal Snyder]]. It turns out Buffy and her friends organized the graduating students to fight back against Wilkins, with Angel leading the fight against his minions. Buffy confronts the demon, taunting him about Faith. She lures the provoked Mayor into the library which was rigged with explosives. The explosion is set off, destroying Wilkins and his Olvikan form. 

Meanwhile, Angel becomes convinced that Buffy's love for him will be bad for her in the long run; after the battle with the Mayor he leaves Sunnydale, leading to the [[Angel (tv series)|spinoff series]] in Los Angeles.
