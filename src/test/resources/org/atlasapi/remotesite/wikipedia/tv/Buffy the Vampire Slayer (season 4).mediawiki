The '''fourth season''' of the television series '''''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''''' premiered on October 5, 1999, on [[The WB Television Network]] and concluded its 22-episode season on May 23, 2000. It maintained its previous timeslot, airing Tuesdays at 8:00 pm ET. Beginning with this season, the character of [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] was given his own series, titled ''[[Angel (TV series)|Angel]]'', which aired on The WB following ''Buffy''. Various ''Buffy'' characters made appearances in ''Angel'', including Buffy herself; [[Cordelia Chase]], formerly a regular in ''Buffy'', and [[Wesley Wyndam-Pryce]], who appeared in ''Buffy'' season 3, became regulars in ''Angel''.

== Plot ==
Season four sees [[Buffy Summers|Buffy]] and [[Willow Rosenberg|Willow]] enroll at [[University of California|UC]] [[Sunnydale]] while [[Xander Harris|Xander]] joins the workforce. The vampire [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]], having left [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]], returns to Sunnydale and is abducted by [[Initiative (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Initiative]], a top-secret military installation based beneath the UC Sunnydale campus, led by [[Maggie Walsh]]. They implant a [[Integrated circuit|microchip]] in his head which prevents him from harming humans. He reluctantly helps the [[Scooby Gang (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Scooby Gang]] throughout the season and eventually begins to fight on their side after learning that he can harm other demons. But Buffy and her friends don't trust him except Willow who opts to give him a chance to redeem himself, which they eventually do. 

[[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Oz]] leaves town after realizing that he is too dangerous as a werewolf and after a horrific encounter with The Initiative. Willow falls in love with [[Tara Maclay]], another witch. They begin a relationship.

Another focus of the season is Xander's relationship with a former vengeance demon named [[Anya Jenkins]], who becomes infatuated with him due to him making her feel human and Xander returns these feelings as she makes him feel like a man. However, Anya tries to get Xander off her mind but their feelings are developed and they begin a relationship

Buffy begins dating [[Riley Finn]], a grad student who she later discovers is a member of The Initiative. He tries to get her recruited but she becomes an object of negative attention from Maggie Walsh. Walsh believes Buffy to be a bad influence to Riley, threatening his ties with The Initiative. After Buffy and Riley's first sexual encounter, Walsh tries to get Buffy killed, which causes Riley to cut ties with Walsh and The Initiative.

It is realized that The Initiative has more sinister plans as its cyborg demonoid hybrid secret project, [[Adam (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Adam]], escapes and begins to wreak havoc on the town after killing Walsh. After getting Spike to temporarily work for him, Adam plots to create a cyborg demonoid race to overthrow humanity, though Adam sees Riley as a "brother".

Buffy and her allies, upon learning of Adam plans, unite to defeat Adam and destroy The Initiative. The demons and other supernatural creatures fight back against their former captors, while the Scoobies temporarily transfer all their powers into Buffy to fight the physically superior Adam. She kills Adam by ripping his uranium core. Soon The Initiative is defeated and the Scoobies recover.

=== Crossovers with ''Angel'' ===
Beginning with this season, ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and its [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[Angel (TV series)|Angel]]'' both aired on [[The WB Television Network]]. Both shows aired on Tuesdays, ''Buffy'' at 8:00 PM ET, and ''Angel'' at 9:00 PM ET. The fourth season of ''Buffy'' aired along with the [[Angel (season 1)|first season]] of ''Angel''. Both shows featured [[Fictional crossover#Television series|crossover episodesIterator]], in which characters of one series appeared in the other.  [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] ([[David Boreanaz]]), [[Cordelia Chase]] ([[Charisma Carpenter]]) and [[Wesley Wyndam-Pryce]] ([[Alexis Denisof]]), who had been introduced in ''Buffy'', became main characters in the spinoff series.

The first crossover appeared in the premiere episodesIterator, where Angel calls Buffy but doesn't say anything; on ''Buffy'', she is seen answering the phone. After the events of "[[The Harsh Light of Day (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Harsh Light of Day]]", [[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Oz]] ([[Seth Green]]) visits Los Angeles in the ''Angel'' episode "[[In the Dark (Angel)|In the Dark]]" to give Angel the Gem of Amarra (a ring that makes vampires unkillable), and [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] ([[James Marsters]]) follows him.

In the ''Angel'' episode "[[Bachelor Party (Angel)|Bachelor Party]]", [[Doyle (Angel)|Doyle]] ([[Glenn Quinn]]) has a vision of Buffy in danger. This causes Angel to secretly visit Sunnydale in the episode "[[Pangs]]", to protect her. After learning that he was in town, [[Buffy Summers|Buffy]] ([[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]) visits L.A. in the ''Angel'' episode "[[I Will Remember You (Angel)|I Will Remember You]]" to express her displeasure in his not telling her that he was there.

''Buffy'' season three recurring character [[Wesley Wyndam-Pryce]] ([[Alexis Denisof]]) makes his first appearance on ''Angel'' in "[[Parting Gifts]]" and would become a series regular in the next episode for the remainder of the series.

After the events of the two-part episode "[[This Year's Girl]]" and "[[Who Are You (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Who Are You]]", [[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]] ([[Eliza Dushku]]) leaves Sunnydale and goes to L.A. in the ''Angel'' two-part episode "[[Five by Five (Angel)|Five by Five]]" and "[[Sanctuary (Angel episode)|Sanctuary]]" and is hired by [[Wolfram & Hart]] to kill Angel. Buffy makes her second and final appearance on ''Angel'' in "Sanctuary".

Angel visits Sunnydale again in "[[The Yoko Factor]]" to apologize to Buffy after the way he treated her in "Sanctuary". Angel meets Buffy's new boyfriend, [[Riley Finn]] ([[Marc Blucas]]).

The vampire [[Darla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Darla]] ([[Julie Benz]]), who was killed in ''Buffy'' episode "[[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode)|Angel]]", is resurrected by Wolfram & Hart in the ''Angel'' season one finale, "[[To Shanshu in L.A.]]", and subsequently becomes a recurring character there.

== Reception ==
The series received three [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations, for Outstanding Hairstyling for a Series for "[[Beer Bad]]", [[Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series|Outstanding Cinematography for a Single Camera Series]] ([[Michael Gershman (director)|Michael Gershman]]) for "[[Hush (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Hush]]", and [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series|Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series]] ([[Joss Whedon]]) for "Hush".

In particular, the episode "Hush" was highly praised when it aired. Robert Bianco from ''[[USA Today]]'' comments, "(i)n a medium in which producers tend to grow bored with their own creations, either trashing them or taking them in increasingly bizarre directions, Whedon continues to find new ways to make his fabulously entertaining series richer and more compelling. With or without words, he's a TV treasure."<ref>Bianco, Robert (December 14, 1999). "Critic's Corner", ''USA Today'', p. 12D.</ref> Alan Sepinwall in ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' calls it a "magnificently daring episode", explaining "(w)hat makes it particularly brave is that, even when ''Buffy'' has been failing to click dramatically this year, the show has still been able to get by on the witty dialogue, which is all but absent after the first few scenes. Whedon finds ways to get around that, with several cast members—particularly Anthony Head as the scholarly Giles and Alyson Hannigan as nervous witch Willow—proving to be wonderfully expressive silent comedians."<ref>Sepinwall, Alan (December 14, 1999). "All TV - Buffy loses voice, gains magic", ''The Star-Ledger'' (Newark, NJ).</ref>  In the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'', David Bianculli states that the episode is "a true tour de force, and another inventive triumph for this vastly underrated series."<ref>Bianculli, David (March 21, 2000). "TV Tonight", ''New York Daily News'', p. 78.</ref> Robert Hanks from ''[[The Independent]]'' in the UK writes that "''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'', in most weeks the funniest and cleverest programme on TV, reached new heights" with "Hush".<ref>Hanks, Robert (December 22, 2000).

Everybody's had 'em—and yet the way the eerie quiet of 'Hush' sucks you in, you feel as if the experience is privately, and unequivocally, your own."<ref>"[http://www.salon.com/entertainment/movies/feature/2002/10/31/scary Truly scary stuff]", Salon.com (October 31, 2002).
