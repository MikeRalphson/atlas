Fictional narratives (and works of art) exist beyond their completion, e.g. ''A Tale of Two Cities'' is a novel (we do not say ''A Tale of Two Cities'' was a novel), The Mona Lisa is a painting (we do not say the Mona Lisa was a painting). They were completed in the past we can say ''A Tale of Two Cities'' was completed in the 19th century, but we cannot say it was a novel, it is a novel.

Here is a passage from [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction)]] which hints at why this is so:

"The story that each work of fiction depicts does not change despite the continuation of stories across serial works or sequels, and as a consequence, the events within one work of fiction are always in the present whenever it is read, watched, or listened to."

Please do not change the tense in this passage without contributing to discussion on the talk page, [[Talk:Buffy the Vampire Slayer]].
-->'''''Buffy the Vampire Slayer''''' <!-- read above before changing tense -->is <!-- read above before changing tense --> an American television series which aired from March 10, 1997 until May 20, 2003. The series was created in 1997 by writer-director [[Joss Whedon]] under his production tag, [[Mutant Enemy Productions]] with later co-executive producers being [[Jane Espenson]], [[David Fury]], [[David Greenwalt]], [[Doug Petrie]], [[Marti Noxon]], and [[David Solomon (TV producer)|David Solomon]]. The series narrative follows [[Buffy Summers]] (played by [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]), the latest in a line of young women known as "Vampire Slayers" or simply "Slayers". In the story, Slayers are "called" (chosen by [[destiny|fate]]) to battle against [[Vampire (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|vampires]], [[Demon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|demons]], and other forces of darkness. Like previous [[Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Slayers]], Buffy is aided by a [[Watcher (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Watcher]], who guides, teaches, and trains her. Unlike her predecessors, Buffy surrounds herself with a circle of loyal friends who become known as the "[[Scooby Gang (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Scooby Gang]]".

The series received critical and popular acclaim and usually reached between four and six million viewers on original airings.<ref name = "insightbb-buffy">{{cite web|author=Wahoske, Matthew J.|url=http://home.insightbb.com/~wahoskem/buffy.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080216043137/http://home.insightbb.com/~wahoskem/buffy.html|archivedate=February 16, 2008|title=Nielsen Ratings For Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Angel, And Firefly|work=Insightbb.com}}</ref> Although such [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] are lower than successful shows on the "big four" networks ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[NBC]], and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/Orders/2001/fcc01133.txt |title=The Dual Network Rule |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |date=May 15, 2001 |quote=[T]he four major broadcast networks are unique among the media in their ability to reach a wide audience}}</ref> they were a success for the relatively new and smaller [[The WB Television Network|WB Television Network]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation |url=http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Speaker-Biographies-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf#search=%22%20Dawson's%20Creek%2C%20Buffy%20is%20often%20associated%20with%20the%20early%20success%20of%20the%20Warner%20Brothers%20Network.%22 |title=Generation M: Media in the Lives of 8–18 Year Olds|publisher=Kff.org |date=March 9, 2005 |quote=Mr. Levin was a key player in establishing The WB's distinct brand and youth appeal through programming such as ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'', ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'', ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]'', ''[[Charmed]]'', ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'', ''[[Everwood]]'' and ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]''}}</ref> The show was ranked 41st on ''TV Guide'''s list of [[TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time|50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time]], second on ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]''{{'}}s "50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time", voted third in 2004 and 2007 on ''TV Guide''{{'}}s "Top Cult Shows Ever"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.tannerworld.com/showthread.php?t=4001|title=TV Guide's 25 Top Cult Shows|publisher=TannerWorld Junction|date=May 26, 2004|accessdate=July 11, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/top-cult-shows-40239.aspx|title=TV Guide Names the Top Cult Shows Ever|work=TV Guide|date=June 29, 2007|accessdate=July 11, 2011}}</ref> and listed in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's "100 Best TV Shows of All-''Time''".<ref name="Time 100">{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2007/09/06/the-100-best-tv-shows-of-all-time/slide/buffy-the-vampire-slayer/ |title=The  100 Best TV Shows of All-''Time''  |first=James |last=Poniewozik |authorlink=James Poniewozik |work=Time  |publisher=Time.com |date=September 6, 2007}}</ref> In 2013 ''[[TV Guide]]'' also included it in its list of The 60 Greatest Dramas of All Time.<ref>Roush, Matt (February 25, 2013).

==Production==

===Origins===
[[File:Joss Whedon premiere.jpg|200px|thumb|''Buffy'' creator Joss Whedon also served as executive producer, head writer, and director on the series.]]
Writer [[Joss Whedon]] says that "Rhonda the Immortal Waitress" was really the first incarnation of the ''Buffy'' concept, "just the idea of some woman who seems to be completely insignificant who turns out to be extraordinary."<ref>{"Buffy: Television with Bite" ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer DVDs#Season 6|Buffy sixth season DVD set]]'', Disc six (2003), 2:15.</ref> This early, unproduced idea evolved into ''Buffy'', which Whedon developed to invert the Hollywood formula of "the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every [[horror film|horror movie]]."<ref name=blondegirl>{{cite book |last=Billson |first=Anne |title=[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (BFI TV Classics)|]] |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |date=December 5, 2005 |pages=24–25}}</ref> Whedon wanted "to subvert that idea and create someone who was a hero."<ref name=blondegirl /> He explained, "The very first mission statement of the show was the joy of female power: having it, using it, sharing it."<ref>{{cite web |last=Gottlieb |first=Allie |url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/09.26.02/buffy1-0239.html |title=Buffy's Angels |publisher=Metroactive.com |date=September 26, 2002}}</ref>

The idea was first visited through Whedon's script for the 1992 movie ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (film)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', which featured [[Kristy Swanson]] in the title role. The director, [[Fran Rubel Kuzui]], saw it as a "pop culture comedy about what people think about [[vampire]]s."<ref>{{cite book |last=Havens |first=Candace |title=Joss Whedon: The Genius Behind Buffy |publisher=Benbella Books |date=May 1, 2003 |page=51}}</ref><ref>Fran Kuzui also discussed ''Buffy'' in {{cite book |last=Golden |first=Christopher |last=Holder |first=Nancy |title=[[List of Buffyverse guidebooks#"Watcher's Guides"|Watcher's Guide Vol. 1]] |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |date=October 1, 1998 pages=247–248}}</ref> Whedon disagreed: "I had written this scary film about an empowered woman, and they turned it into a broad comedy. It was crushing."<ref>Havens, p. 23.</ref> The script was praised within the industry,<ref>{{cite web |last=Brundage |first=James |url=http://www.filmcritic.com/reviews/1992/buffy-the-vampire-slayer/?OpenDocument |title=''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' film review |publisher=Filmcritic.com |year=1999}}</ref> but the movie was not.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/buffy_the_vampire_slayer/ |title=''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' |publisher=Rottentomatoes.com}}</ref>

Several years later, [[Gail Berman]] (later a Fox executive, but at that time President and CEO of the production company [[Sandollar Productions|Sandollar]] Television, who owned the TV rights to the movie) approached Whedon to develop his ''Buffy'' concept into a television series.<ref>Golden & and Holder, pp. 249–250.</ref> Whedon explained that "They said, 'Do you want to do a show?' And I thought, 'High school as a horror movie.' And so the metaphor became the central concept behind ''Buffy'', and that's how I sold it."<ref>{{cite web |last=Said |first=SF |url=http://www.shebytches.com/SFSaidgb.html |title=Interview with Joss Whedon by SF Said |publisher=Shebytches.com |year=2005 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100512141258/http://www.shebytches.com/SFSaidgb.html |archivedate=May 12, 2010}}</ref> The [[supernatural]] elements in the series stood as [[metaphor]]s for personal anxieties associated with [[adolescence]] and young adulthood.<ref name="FtF-Intro">{{cite book |last1=Wilcox |first1=Rhonda V. |first2=David |last2=Lavery |title=Fighting the Forces: What's at Stake in ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' |chapter=Introduction |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |date= April 2002 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=amKx_wH-PDYC&pg=PR17&dq=buffy+forces+introduction |pages=xix |nopp=true |isbn=978-0-7425-1681-6}}</ref> Early in its development, the series was going to be simply titled ''Slayer''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tv-titles-how-to-choose-them-298110 |title=The Art of Picking TV Titles: 9 Do's and Don'ts |work=The Hollywood Reporter |first1= Lacey |last1=Rose |first2=Marisa |last2=Guthrie |date=March 9, 2012 |accessdate=March 9, 2012}}</ref> Whedon went on to write and partly fund a 25-minute [[Unaired Buffy the Vampire Slayer pilot|non-broadcast pilot]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Topping |first=Keith |title=[[List of Buffyverse guidebooks#Keith Topping|Slayer]] |publisher=[[Virgin Publishing]] |date=December 1, 2004 |page=7}}</ref> that was shown to networks and eventually sold to the [[WB Network]]. The latter promoted the premiere with a series of ''History of the Slayer'' clips,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvobscurities.com/articles/forgotten_buffy/ |title=''Buffy, The Vampire Slayer'', Forgotten Premiere Trailer |publisher=Tvobscurities.com |date=July 16, 2003}}</ref> and the [[Welcome to the Hellmouth|first episode]] aired on March 10, 1997.

===Executive producers===
Joss Whedon was credited as [[executive producer]] throughout the run of the series, and for the first five seasons (1997–2001) he was also the [[showrunner]], supervising the writing and all aspects of production. [[Marti Noxon]] took on the role for seasons six and seven (2001–2003), but Whedon continued to be involved with writing and directing ''Buffy'' alongside projects such as ''[[Angel (TV series)|Angel]]'', ''[[Fray]]'', and ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]''. Fran Rubel Kuzui and her husband, [[Kaz Kuzui]], were credited as executive producers<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118276/fullcredits#cast |title=''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' (1997) — Full Cast and Crew |work=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=July 28, 2012}}</ref> but were not involved in the show. Their credit, rights, and [[royalties]] over the franchise relate to their funding, producing, and directing of the original movie version of ''Buffy''.<ref>Golden and Holder, p. 241. "Gail Berman and Fran Kuzui came to Whedon to ask if he wanted to do the TV series." See also, pp. 246–249.</ref>

===Writing===
[[Screenwriting|Script-writing]] was done by [[Mutant Enemy Productions|Mutant Enemy]], a production company created by Whedon in 1997. The writers with the most writing credits<ref name="buffywriters1">{{cite web |publisher=BBC |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/buffy/indetail/ |title=Buffy Episode Guide}}</ref> are [[Joss Whedon]], [[Steven S. DeKnight]], [[Jane Espenson]], [[David Fury]], [[Drew Goddard]], [[Drew Greenberg]], [[David Greenwalt]], [[Rebecca Rand Kirshner]], [[Marti Noxon]] and [[Doug Petrie]]. Other authors with writing credits include Dean Batali, [[Carl Ellsworth]], [[Tracey Forbes]], [[Ashley Gable]], [[Howard Gordon]], Diego Gutierrez, Elin Hampton, Rob Des Hotel, Matt Kiene, Ty King, Thomas A. Swyden, Joe Reinkemeyer, Dana Reston and [[Dan Vebber]].<ref name="buffywriters2">{{cite web |publisher=TV.com |url=http://www.tv.com/buffy-the-vampire-slayer/show/10/cast.html?flag=3&tag=subtabs;writers_directors |title=List of Buffy Writers}}</ref>

[[Jane Espenson]] has explained how scripts came together.<ref>{{cite web |last=Espenson |first=Jane |url=http://www.janeespenson.com/writing_process.php |title=The Writing Process |publisher=JaneEspenson.com |year=2003 |accessdate=March 9, 2013}}</ref> First, the writers talked about the emotional issues facing Buffy Summers and how she would confront them through her battle against evil supernatural forces. Then the episode's story was "broken" into acts and scenes. Act breaks were designed as key moments to intrigue viewers so that they would stay with the episode following the [[television advertisement|commercial break]]. The writers collectively filled in scenes surrounding these act breaks for a more fleshed-out story. A whiteboard marked their progress by mapping brief descriptions of each scene. Once "breaking" was done, the credited author wrote an outline for the episode, which was checked by Whedon or Noxon. The writer then wrote a full script, which went through a series of drafts, and finally a quick rewrite from the show runner. The final article was used as the shooting script.

===Casting===
Actresses who auditioned for Buffy Summers and got other roles include [[Julie Benz]] (Darla), [[Elizabeth Anne Allen]] (Amy Madison), [[Julia Lee (actress)|Julia Lee]] (Chanterelle/Lily Houston/Anne Steele), [[Charisma Carpenter]] (Cordelia Chase), and [[Mercedes McNab]] (Harmony Kendall). [[Bianca Lawson]], who played vampire slayer Kendra Young in season 2 of the show, originally auditioned for the role of Cordelia Chase before Charisma Carpenter was cast in the role.

The title role went to [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]], who had appeared as Sydney Rutledge on ''[[Swans Crossing]]'' and [[Kendall Hart]] on ''[[All My Children]]''. At age 18 in 1995, Gellar had already won a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Younger Leading Actress in a Drama Series.<ref name="smgawards">{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001264/awards |title=Awards for Sarah Michelle Gellar |work=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=July 28, 2012}}</ref> In 1996, she was initially [[casting (performing arts)|cast]] as [[Cordelia Chase]] during a week of auditioning. She decided to keep trying for the role of Buffy, and after several more auditions, she landed the lead.<ref name="smgauditions">Havens, pp. 35–36.</ref>

[[Nathan Fillion]] auditioned for the role of [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] back in early 1996. [[David Boreanaz]] had already been cast at the time of the [[Unaired Buffy the Vampire Slayer pilot|unaired ''Buffy'' pilot]], but did not appear.

[[Anthony Head|Anthony Stewart Head]] had already led a prolific acting and singing career,<ref name="headimdb">{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0372117/ |title=Anthony Head |work=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=July 28, 2012}}</ref> but remained best known in the United States for a series of twelve coffee commercials with [[Sharon Maughan]] for [[Nescafé]].<ref>Golden & Holder, p. 210. "His long-lasting fame as the romantic and intriguing coffee guy is gradually being replaced by his new image as librarian in ''Buffy''."</ref> He accepted the role of [[Rupert Giles]]. Unlike other ''Buffy'' regulars, [[Nicholas Brendon]] had little acting experience, instead working various jobs—including [[production assistant]], plumber's assistant, veterinary janitor, food delivery, script delivery, day care counselor, and waiter—before breaking into acting and overcoming his [[stuttering|stutter]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nickbrendon.com/biography/ |publisher=NickBrendon.com |title=Biography}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Kappes |first=Serena |url=http://nickbrendon.com/2001/05/01/xander-slays-his-demon/ |title=Xander Slays His Demon |publisher=Nickbrendon.com, originally from People.com |date=May 2001}}</ref> He landed his [[Xander Harris]] role following only four days of auditioning.<ref>Golden & Holder, p. 199. Brendon said "Four days. That's fast."</ref> [[Ryan Reynolds]] and [[Danny Strong]] also auditioned for the part. Strong later played the role of Jonathan Levinson, a recurring character for much of the series run.

[[Alyson Hannigan]] was the last of the original six to be cast. Following her role in ''[[My Stepmother Is an Alien]]'',<ref name="hanniganimdb">{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004989/ |title=Alyson Hannigan |work=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=July 28, 2012}}</ref> she appeared in commercials and supporting roles on television shows throughout the early 1990s.<ref name="hanniganimdb" /> In 1996, the role of [[Willow Rosenberg]] was initially played by Riff Regan for the unaired ''Buffy'' pilot, but Hannigan auditioned when the role was being recast for the series proper. Hannigan described her approach to the character through Willow's reaction to a particular moment: Willow sadly tells Buffy that her [[Barbie]] doll was taken from her as a child. Buffy asks her if she ever got it back. Willow's line was to reply "most of it." Hannigan decided on an upbeat and happy delivery of the line "most of it," as opposed to a sad, depressed delivery. Hannigan figured Willow would be happy and proud that she got "most of it" back. That indicated how she was going to play the rest of the scene, and the role, for that matter, and defined the character.<ref>Golden & Holder, p. 202.</ref> Her approach subsequently got her the role.

===Broadcast history and syndication===

In the United Kingdom, the entire series aired on [[Sky1]] and [[BBC Two]]. After protests from fans about early episodes being edited for their pre-[[watershed (broadcasting)|watershed]] time-slot, from the second run (mid-second season onwards), the BBC gave the show two time slots: the early-evening slot (typically Thursday at 6:45&nbsp;pm) for a family-friendly version with violence, objectionable language and other stronger material cut out, and a late-night uncut version (initially late-night Sundays, but for most of the run, late-night Fridays; exact times varied).<ref>Burr, Vivien, "[http://slayageonline.com/essays/slayage8/Burr.htm Buffy vs the BBC: Moral Questions and How to Avoid Them]" ''Slayageonline.com'' (March 2003), p1.</ref> Sky1 aired the show typically at 8:00&nbsp;pm on Thursdays. From the fourth season onwards, the BBC aired the show in anamorphic 16:9 [[Widescreen#Widescreen TV and computer displays|widescreen]] format. Whedon later said that ''Buffy'' was never intended to be viewed this way.<ref>"[http://web.archive.org/web/20070927190217/http://www.videostoremag.com/news/html/breaking_article.cfm?sec_id=2&article_ID=5243 Angel Creator Joss Whedon Sees Evolution of TV Shows on DVD]" ''Video Store Mag'' (August 28, 2003).</ref> Despite his claims, Sky1 and [[Syfy (UK and Ireland)|Syfy]] now air repeat showings in the widescreen format.

===Opening sequence===
The ''Buffy'' [[title sequence|opening sequence]] provides credits early in each show. The music was performed by the rock band [[Nerf Herder]]. The melody is similar to that of an Austrian pop song from the 1980s called "[[Deutsch-Österreichisches Feingefühl#"Codo"|Codo]]" by [[Deutsch-Österreichisches Feingefühl|DÖF]], but Nerf Herder have said that they had "never heard of DÖF" and the similarity was coincidental.<ref>"[http://whedonesque.com/comments/11527 Before Nerf Herder, the original Buffy theme: "Codo" by 1980s Austrian band, DÖF.]" ''Whedonesque.com'' (October 2006).</ref> In the DVD commentary for the [[Welcome to the Hellmouth|first ''Buffy'' episode]], Whedon said his decision to go with Nerf Herder's theme was influenced by cast member Alyson Hannigan, who had made him listen to the band's music.<ref>''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' first season DVD set. ''20th century Fox'' (region 2, 2000), disc one.</ref> Janet Halfyard, in her essay "Music, Gender, and Identity in ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ''Angel''," describes the opening:

{{quote|Firstly ... we have the sound of an [[organ (music)|organ]], accompanied by a [[wolf]]’s howl, with a visual image of a flickering night sky overlaid with unintelligible archaic script: the associations with both the [[silent film|silent era]] and films such as ''[[Nosferatu]]'' and with the conventions of the [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer House of Horror]] and horror in general are unmistakable.<ref name="halfyard" />}}

But the theme quickly changes: "It removes itself from the sphere of 1960s and 70s horror by replaying the same motif, the organ now supplanted by an aggressively strummed electric guitar, relocating itself in modern youth culture ...."<ref name="halfyard">Halfyard, Janet K. "[http://slayageonline.com/essays/slayage4/halfyard.htm Love, Death, Curses and Reverses (in F minor): Music, Gender, and Identity in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel]", ''[http://slayageonline.com/ Slayageonline.com]'' (December 2001).</ref> This music is heard over images of a young cast involved in the action and turbulence of adolescence. The sequence provides a [[postmodernism|post-modern]] twist on the horror genre.<ref name="halfyard" />

The brief clips of characters and events which compose the opening sequence are updated from season to season. The only shots that persist across all seven seasons are those of a book titled ''Vampyr'' and of the cross given to Buffy by Angel in the first episode. Each sequence ends with a lingering shot of Buffy, which changes between seasons. In seasons six and seven, the final shots of Gellar are respectively as [[Buffybot]] in "[[The Gift (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Gift]]" (season five finale) and the [[First Evil]] posing as Buffy in "[[Lessons (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Lessons]]" (season seven premiere). The only exception was in the season four episode "[[Superstar (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Superstar]]," which featured a long shot of [[Jonathan Levinson]].

Four episodes feature an opening sequence that is unique to that specific episode. The fourth season episode "[[Superstar (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Superstar]]" is the same as the season four credits except numerous clips of Jonathan are added in, replacing some heroic action clips of Buffy. This is a humorous reference to the episode, where Jonathan has bewitched the people of Sunnydale into perceiving him as a heroic worldwide idol for them all, which they forget about after the spell is broken at the end of the episode. The fifth season premiere "[[Buffy vs. Dracula]]" has the regular season five credits with the omission of the Michelle Trachtenberg (Dawn) scenes from the title sequence. She is instead credited as a guest star. The season six episode "[[Once More, with Feeling (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Once More, with Feeling]]" has a different opening theme song and credits. The season six episode "[[Seeing Red (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Seeing Red]]" added [[Amber Benson]] (Tara) into the regular season six opening credits for her final episode.

===Music===
{{main|Music in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel}}

''Buffy'' features a mix of [[film score|original]], [[independent music|indie]], rock and pop music. The composers spent around seven days scoring between fourteen to thirty minutes of music for each episode.<ref name = "dvdfeature"/> [[Christophe Beck]] revealed that the [[List of Buffyverse cast and crew#Composers|''Buffy'' composers]] used computers and synthesizers and were limited to recording one or two "real" samples. Despite this, their goal was to produce "dramatic" orchestration that would stand up to film scores.<ref name = "dvdfeature"/>

Alongside the score, most episodes featured indie rock music, usually at the characters' venue of choice, [[The Bronze]]. ''Buffy'' music supervisor John King explained that "we like to use unsigned bands" that "you would believe would play in this place."<ref name="dvdfeature">"Buffy: Inside the Music" from "[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer DVDs#Season 4|Buffy the Vampire Slayer Complete Fourth Season DVD set]] ''20th century Fox'' (May 13, 2002), disc three.</ref> For example, the fictional group [[Dingoes Ate My Baby (band)|Dingoes Ate My Baby]] were portrayed on screen by front group [[Four Star Mary]].<ref name="dingoesmary">{{cite web|url=http://www.fourstarmary.com/bioscontent.html|title=Four Star Mary Bios|publisher=Four Star Mary|accessdate=July 22, 2008}}</ref> Pop songs by famous artists were rarely featured prominently, but several episodes spotlighted the sounds of more famous artists such as [[Sarah McLachlan]],<ref name="sarahmcbuffy">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/buffy/indetail/becomingtwo/trivia.shtml|title=BBC Cult Buffy Trivia – 'Becoming, Part Two'|publisher=BBC|accessdate=July 22, 2008}}</ref><ref name="sarahmcbuffy1">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/buffy/indetail/grave/trivia.shtml|title=BBC Cult Buffy Trivia – 'Grave'|publisher=BBC|accessdate=July 22, 2008}}</ref> [[The Brian Jonestown Massacre]], [[Blink-182]],<ref name="blinkbuffy">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/buffy/indetail/somethingblue/trivia.shtml|title=BBC Cult Buffy Trivia – 'Something Blue'|publisher=BBC Cult Buffy Trivia|accessdate=July 22, 2008}}</ref> [[Third Eye Blind]],<ref name="thirdeyebuffy">{{cite web|url=http://www.buffyguide.com/episodes/faithhope.shtml|title='Faith, Hope, and Trick' at BuffyGuide|publisher=BuffyGuide|accessdate=July 22, 2008}}</ref> [[Aimee Mann]]<ref name="aimeebuffy2">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/buffy/indetail/sleeper/trivia.shtml|title=BBC Cult Buffy Trivia – 'Sleeper'|publisher=BBC|accessdate=July 22, 2008}}</ref> (who also had a line of dialogue), [[The Dandy Warhols]],<ref name="dandywarholsbuffy">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/buffy/indetail/triangle/trivia.shtml|title=BBC Cult Buffy Trivia – 'Triangle'|publisher=BBC|accessdate=July 22, 2008}}</ref> [[Cibo Matto]],<ref name="cibobuffy">{{cite web|url=http://www.wbr.com/laramie/laramie_press.html|title=Cibo Matto Press Release|publisher=Cibo Matto Official Website|accessdate=July 22, 2008}}</ref> [[Coldplay]], [[Lisa Loeb]], [[K's Choice]] and [[Michelle Branch]].<ref name="michellebuffy">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/buffy/indetail/tabularasa/trivia.shtml|title=BBC Cult Buffy Trivia – 'Tabula Rasa'|publisher=BBC|accessdate=July 22, 2008}}</ref> The popularity of [[Music in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel|music used in ''Buffy'']] has led to the release of four soundtrack albums: ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Album]]'',<ref name="amazonbuffyq">{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00001R3O2|title='Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Album' at Amazon|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=July 22, 2008}}</ref> ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Radio Sunnydale – Music from the TV Series|Radio Sunnydale]]'',<ref name="amazonbuffy1">{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000E6EFX|title='Radio Sunnydale' Album at Amazon|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=July 22, 2008}}</ref> the ''[[Once More, with Feeling (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|"Once More, with Feeling" Soundtrack]]'',<ref name="amazonbuffy2">{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00006J3WH|title='Once More With Feeling!'

==Setting and storylines==

===Setting and filming locations===
:''Main articles: [[Sunnydale]], [[Hellmouth (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Hellmouth]] and [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer filming locations|Filming locations]]''

[[File:THS facade.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Torrance High School]] was used for the fictional Sunnydale High School in the series.]]

Most of ''Buffy'' was shot on location in [[Los Angeles, California]]. The main exterior set of the town of [[Sunnydale]], including the infamous "sun sign," was located in [[Santa Monica, California]] in a lot on [[Olympic Boulevard (Los Angeles)|Olympic Boulevard]].<ref name="INSERT NAME">Various authors, "[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118276/locations Sets and Locations]", ''The Ultimate Buffy and Angel Trivia Guide'' (updated 2007).<!-- Various authors, "[http://www.restlessbtvs.com/trivia/category/behind-the-scenes/sets-and-locations/ Filming Locations for Buffy the Vampire Slayer]", ''IMDb.com'' (updated 2006).--></ref> The show is set in the fictional California town of Sunnydale, whose suburban [[Sunnydale High|Sunnydale High School]] sits on top of a "[[Hellmouth (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Hellmouth]]," a [[Portal (doorway)|gateway]] to demon realms. The Hellmouth, located beneath the [[Sunnydale High School library|school library]], is a source of mystical energies as well as a [[wikt:nexus|nexus]] for a wide variety of evil creatures and supernatural phenomena. In addition to being an open-ended plot device, Joss Whedon has cited the Hellmouth and "[[High school]] as [[Hell]]" as one of the primary metaphors in creating the series.<ref>Yovanovich, Linda, "Young Blood", ''Smgfan.com'', originally from ''OnSat'' (July 14, 1997), Whedon said: "[High school as hell] was always the basis of the show. When they said, 'Do you want to turn it into a show?' The character was not enough alone to sustain it. But you know when I thought of the idea of the horror movies as a metaphor for high school, [I said] okay this is something that will work week to week."</ref>

The high school used in the first three seasons is actually [[Torrance High School]], in [[Torrance, California]]. This school was used until the residents of Torrance complained about loud sounds at night.<ref name="torrence">"[http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/b/buffy.html Buffy the Vampire Slayer film locations]", ''Movie-locations.com''</ref> The school exterior has been used in other television shows and movies, most notably ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'', ''[[Bring It On (film)|Bring It On]]'', ''[[She's All That]]'' and the [[parody|spoof]] ''[[Not Another Teen Movie]]''.<ref name="torrence" /> In addition to the high school and its library, scenes take place in the town's cemeteries, a local nightclub (The Bronze), and Buffy's home (located in Torrance), where many of the characters live at various points in the series.

Some of the exterior shots of the college Buffy attends, UC Sunnydale, were filmed at [[UCLA]].  Several episodes include shots from the Oviatt Library at [[CSUN]].<ref name="CSUN WIKI">Various authors,
"[[California State University, Northridge#Film and television shoots]]", "California State University, Northridge: Film & Television Shoots."</ref><ref name="BUFFY CSUN">CSUN Oviatt Library Website, "[http://library.csun.edu/About/InMedia]", "Oviatt Library In The Media"</ref>

===Format===
''Buffy'' is told in a [[Serial (radio and television)|serialized]] format, with each episode involving a self-contained story while contributing to a larger [[story arc|storyline]],<ref name="FtF-Intro" /> which is broken down into season-long narratives marked by the rise and defeat of a powerful [[antagonist]], commonly referred to as the "[[Big Bad]]." While the show is mainly a [[drama]] with frequent [[comic relief]], most episodes blend different [[genre]]s, including [[horror film|horror]], [[martial arts]], [[Romance film|romance]], [[melodrama]], [[farce]], [[science fiction]], [[Screwball comedy film|comedy]], and even, in [[Once More, with Feeling (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|one episode]], [[musical comedy]].

The series' narrative revolves around Buffy and her friends, collectively dubbed the "[[Scooby Gang (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Scooby Gang]]," who struggle to balance the fight against [[supernatural]] evils with their complex social lives.<ref name="FtF-Intro" /> The show mixes complex, season-long storylines with a [[Villain of the week|villain-of-the-week]] format; a typical episode contains one or more [[villain]]s, or supernatural phenomena, that are thwarted or defeated by the end of the episode. Though elements and relationships are explored and ongoing subplots are included, the show focuses primarily on Buffy and her role as an [[archetype|archetypal]] [[hero]]ine.

In the first few seasons, the most prominent monsters in the [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings|''Buffy'' bestiary]] are [[Vampire (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|vampires]], which are based on traditional myths, lore, and literary conventions. As the series continues, Buffy and her companions fight an increasing variety of [[Demon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|demons]], as well as [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings#Ghosts and spirits|ghosts]], [[Werewolf|werewolves]], [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings#Undead|zombies]], and [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings#Dangerous Mortals|unscrupulous humans]]. They frequently save the world from annihilation by a combination of physical combat, [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], and detective-style investigation, and are guided by an extensive collection of ancient and mystical reference books. Hand-to-hand combat is chiefly undertaken by Buffy and Angel, later by [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]], and to a far lesser degree by Giles and Xander. Willow eventually becomes an adept [[Witch (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|witch]], while Giles contributes his extensive knowledge of [[demonology]] and supernatural lore.

===Inspirations and metaphors===
During the first year of the series, Whedon described the show as "''[[My So-Called Life]]'' meets ''[[The X-Files]].''"<ref>"[http://www.cityofangel.com/council/joss.html Joss Whedon: Executive Producer of Angel]", ''Cityofangel.com'' (2006). Also see Flowers, Phoebe, "[http://www.tvshows.nu/article.php3?id_article=4984 Sixth season was last great one for Buffy – Dvd Review]", ''Tvshows.nu'' (June 16, 2004). Executive Producer [[Marti Noxon]] stated: "I'm basically trying to write ''My So-Called Life'' with vampires."</ref> ''My So-Called Life'' gave a sympathetic portrayal of teen anxieties; in contrast, ''The X-Files'' delivered a supernatural [[Monster of the week|"monster of the week"]] storyline. Alongside these series, Whedon has cited cult film ''[[Night of the Comet]]'' as a "big influence,"<ref>{{cite web |author=P., Ken |url=http://ign.com/articles/2003/06/23/an-interview-with-joss-whedon?page=6 |title=An Interview with Joss Whedon |publisher=IGN |date=June 23, 2003 |accessdate=March 9, 2013}}</ref> and credited the ''[[X-Men]]'' character [[Kitty Pryde]] as a significant influence on the character of Buffy.<ref>Whedon, Joss "[http://whedonesque.com/comments/3095 Kitty Pryde influenced Buffy]" ''Whedonesque.com'' (February 27, 2004).</ref> The authors of the unofficial guidebook ''[[List of Buffyverse guidebooks#"Dusted"|Dusted]]'' point out that the series was often a [[pastiche]], borrowing elements from previous horror novels, movies, and short stories and from such common literary stock as folklore and mythology.<ref>Miles, Lawrence, ''[[List of Buffyverse guidebooks#"Dusted"|Dusted]]'', ''Mad Norwegian Press'' (November 2003).</ref> Nevitt and Smith describe ''Buffy'''s use of pastiche as "post modern [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]]."<ref>Nevitt, Lucy, & Smith, Andy William, "[http://blogs.arts.unimelb.edu.au/refractory/2003/03/18/family-blood-is-always-the-sweetest-the-gothic-transgressions-of-angelangelus-lucy-nevitt-andy-william-smith/ Family Blood is always the Sweetest: The Gothic Transgressions of Angel/Angelusby]", ''Refractory: a Journal of Entertainment Media'' Vol. II (March 2003): Nevitt and Smith bring attention to ''Buffy''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s use of pastiche: "Multiple pastiche without enabling commentary is doubtless self-canceling, yet, at the same time, each element of pastiche calls into temporary being what and why it imitates."</ref> For example, the [[Adam (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Adam]] character parallels the [[Frankenstein's monster|''Frankenstein'' monster]], the episode "[[Bad Eggs (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Bad Eggs]]" parallels ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'', and so on.

''Buffy'' episodes often include a deeper meaning or [[metaphor]] as well. Whedon explained, "We think very carefully about what we're trying to say emotionally, politically, and even philosophically while we're writing it... it really is, apart from being a pop-culture phenomenon, something that is deeply layered textually episode by episode."<ref>[[Ian Shuttleworth|Shuttleworth, Ian]], "[http://web.archive.org/web/20040202205347/http://news.ft.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=FT.com/StoryFT/FullStory&c=StoryFT&cid=1059479741556 Bite me, professor]" ''Financial Times'', citing interview from ''The New York Times'' (September 11, 2003)</ref> Academics Wilcox and Lavery provide examples of how a few episodes deal with real life issues turned into supernatural metaphors:

{{quote|In the world of ''Buffy'' the problems that teenagers face become literal monsters. A mother can take over her daughter's life ("[[Witch (Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode)|Witch]]"); a strict stepfather-to-be really is a heartless machine ("[[Ted (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Ted]]"); a young lesbian fears that her nature is demonic ("[[Goodbye Iowa]]" and "[[Family (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Family]]"); a girl who has sex with even the nicest-seeming guy may discover that he afterwards becomes a monster ("[[Innocence (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Innocence]]").<ref name="FtF-Intro"/>}}

The love affair between the vampire [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] and Buffy was fraught with metaphors. For example, their night of passion cost the vampire his [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]. Sarah Michelle Gellar said: "That's the ultimate metaphor. You sleep with a guy and he turns bad on you."<ref>"[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/05/20/entertainment/main554813.shtml Bye-Bye Buffy]", ''CBSnews.com'' (May 20, 2003).</ref>

Buffy struggles throughout the series with her calling as Slayer and the loss of freedom this entails, frequently sacrificing teenage experiences for her Slayer duties. Her difficulties and eventual empowering realizations are reflections of several dichotomies faced by modern women and echo [[feminism|feminist]] issues within society.<ref>Kaveny, C. (2003, November 7). What Women Want: 'Buffy,' the Pope, and the New Feminists. Commonweal, 18-24.</ref>

In the episode "[[Becoming (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Becoming (Part 2)]]," when Joyce learns that Buffy is the Slayer, her reaction has strong echoes of a parent discovering their child is gay, including denial, suggesting that she try "not being a Slayer," and ultimately kicking Buffy out of the house.<ref name="stafford">{{cite book

===Plot summary===
<!-- THIS SECTION ATTRACTS BLOAT. PLEASE DO NOT ENLARGE IT. ALSO KEEP IN MIND THIS SECTION NEEDS TO BE UNDERSTOOD BY PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT BTVS. KEEP IT SIMPLE! -->

[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 1)|Season one]] exemplifies the "high school as hell" concept. [[Buffy Summers]] has just moved to [[Sunnydale]] after burning down her old school's gym, and hopes to escape her Slayer duties. Her plans are complicated by [[Rupert Giles]], her new [[Watcher (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Watcher]], who reminds her of the inescapable presence of evil. Sunnydale High is built atop a [[Hellmouth (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Hellmouth]], a portal to demon dimensions that attracts supernatural phenomena to the area. Buffy meets two schoolmates, [[Xander Harris]] and [[Willow Rosenberg]], who help her fight evil through the series, but they must first prevent [[Master (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Master]], an ancient and especially threatening vampire, from opening the Hellmouth and taking over Sunnydale.

The emotional stakes are raised in [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 2)|season two]]. Vampires [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] and [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]] (weakened from a mob in Prague, which presumably caused her debilitating injury), come to town along with the new slayer, [[Kendra Young]], who was activated as a result of Buffy's brief death in the [[Prophecy Girl|season one finale]]. Xander becomes involved with [[Cordelia Chase|Cordelia]], while Willow becomes involved with witchcraft and [[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Daniel "Oz" Osbourne]], who is bitten by his young werewolf cousin Jordy and becomes one himself. Buffy and the vampire [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] develop a relationship over the course of the season, but after they sleep together, Angel's soul, given to him by a Gypsy curse in the past, is lost and he once more becomes Angelus, a sadistic killer. Kendra is killed by a restored Drusilla. Angelus torments much of the "Scooby Gang" throughout the rest of the season and murders multiple innocents and Giles's new girlfriend [[Jenny Calendar]], a [[Romani people|gypsy]] who had been sent to maintain Angel's curse. To avert an apocalypse, Buffy is forced to banish Angelus to a demon dimension—right after Willow restores his soul—and leaves Sunnydale, emotionally shattered.

After attempting to start a new life in Los Angeles, Buffy returns to town in [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 3)|season three]]. Angel is mysteriously released from the demon dimension, but is close to insanity due to the torment he suffered there, and is nearly driven to [[suicide]] by the [[First Evil]]. He and Buffy realize that a relationship between them can never happen; he eventually leaves Sunnydale at the end of the season. A new watcher named Wesley is put in Giles's place when he is fired from the Watcher's Council because he had developed a "father's love" for Buffy, and towards the end of the season Buffy announces that she will also no longer be working for the Council. Early in the season, she is confronted with an unstable Slayer, [[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]], who was called after Kendra's death, as well as affable Sunnydale Mayor [[Mayor (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Richard Wilkins]], who has plans to "ascend" (become a "pure" demon) on Sunnydale High's Graduation Day. Although she initially works with Buffy, after accidentally killing a human Faith becomes irrational and sides with the Mayor, eventually landing in a coma after a fight with Buffy. At the end of the season, after the Mayor becomes a huge snake-like demon, Buffy and the entire graduation class destroy him by blowing up Sunnydale High.

[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 4)|Season four]] sees Buffy and Willow enroll at [[University of California|UC]] Sunnydale while Xander joins the workforce and begins dating [[Anya Jenkins|Anya]], a former vengeance demon. Spike returns as a series regular and is abducted by [[The Initiative (Buffyverse)|The Initiative]], a top-secret military installation based beneath the UC Sunnydale campus. They implant a [[Integrated circuit|microchip]] in his head that prevents him from harming humans. He reluctantly helps the Scooby Gang throughout the season and eventually begins to fight on their side after learning that he can still harm other demons. Oz leaves town after realizing that he is too dangerous as a werewolf, and Willow falls in love with [[Tara Maclay]], another witch. Buffy begins dating [[Riley Finn]], a grad student whom she later realizes is a member of The Initiative. Although appearing to be a well-meaning anti-demon operation, The Initiative's sinister plans are revealed when [[Adam (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Adam]], a demon/human/machine [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] secret project, escapes and begins to wreak havoc on the town. Eventually, Buffy - empowered by a spell cast by Willow, Giles and Xander - defeats Adam, and The Initiative is shut down.

During [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 5)|season five]], a younger sister, [[Dawn Summers|Dawn]], suddenly appears in Buffy's life; although she is new to the series, to the characters it is as if she has always been there. Buffy is confronted by [[Glory (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Glory]], an exiled Hell God who is searching for a [[The Key (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|"Key"]] that will allow her to return to her Hell dimension and in the process blur the lines between dimensions and unleash Hell on Earth. It is later discovered that the Key's protectors had turned the Key into human form - Dawn - concurrently implanting everybody with lifelong memories of her. The Watcher's Council aids in Buffy's research of Glory, and she and Giles are both reinstated. Riley leaves early in the season after realizing that Buffy does not love him and joins a military demon-hunting operation. Spike, still implanted with the Initiative chip, realizes he is in love with Buffy and frequently helps the Scoobies in their fight. Buffy's mother [[Joyce Summers|Joyce]] dies of a brain [[aneurysm]], while at the end of the season, Xander proposes to Anya. Glory finally discovers that Dawn is the key and kidnaps her. Buffy sacrifices her own life to save Dawn's and prevent the portal to the Hell dimensions from opening.

At the beginning of [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 6)|season six]], Buffy's friends resurrect her through a powerful spell, believing they have rescued her from Hell. Buffy later reveals she had been in [[Heaven]] and was devastated to be taken back, and falls into a deep depression for most of the season. Giles returns to England after deciding that Buffy has become too reliant on him, while Buffy takes up a fast-food job for income and develops a secret, mutually abusive relationship with Spike. Dawn suffers from [[kleptomania]] and feelings of alienation, Xander leaves Anya at the altar (after which the heartbroken Anya once again becomes a vengeance demon), and Willow becomes addicted to magic, causing Tara to temporarily leave her. They also begin to deal with [[Trio (Buffyverse)|The Trio]], a group of nerds led by [[Warren Mears]] who use their technological proficiency to attempt to kill Buffy and take over Sunnydale. Warren is shown to be the only competent villain of the group and, after Buffy thwarts his plans multiple times and the Trio breaks apart, he becomes unhinged and attacks Buffy with a gun, killing Tara in the process. This causes Willow to descend into darkness and unleash all of her dark magical powers, killing Warren and attempting to kill his friends. Giles returns to face her in battle and infuses her with light magic, tapping into her remaining humanity. This overwhelms Willow with guilt and pain, whereupon she attempts to destroy the world to end everyone's suffering, although it eventually allows Xander to reach through her pain and end her rampage. Late in of the season, after losing control and attacking Buffy, Spike leaves Sunnydale and travels to see a demon and asks him to "return him to what he used to be" so that he can "give Buffy what she deserves." After Spike passes a series of brutal tests, the demon restores his soul.

During [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 7)|season seven]], it is revealed that Buffy's second resurrection caused an instability which allows the First Evil to begin tipping the balance between good and evil. It begins by hunting down and killing inactive [[Potential Slayers]], and soon raises an army of ancient, powerful [[Turok-Han]] vampires. After the Watchers' Council is destroyed, a number of Potential Slayers (some brought by Giles) take refuge in Buffy's house. Faith returns to help fight the First Evil, and the new Sunnydale High School's principal, [[Robin Wood (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Robin Wood]], also joins the cause. The Turok-Han vampires and a sinister, [[misogyny|misogynistic]] preacher known as [[Caleb (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Caleb]] begin causing havoc for the Scoobies. As the Hellmouth becomes more active, nearly all of Sunnydale's population - humans and demons alike - flee. In the series finale, the Scoobies descend into the Hellmouth while Willow casts a spell that activates all the Potential Slayers, giving them Slayer powers. Angel returns to Sunnydale with an amulet, which Buffy gives to Spike. Anya, now human again, dies in the fight, as do some of the new Slayers, but Buffy also manages to kill Caleb. Spike's amulet channels the power of the sun and destroys all the vampires in the Hellmouth, also incinerating Spike himself. This causes the Hellmouth to collapse, and the entirety of Sunnydale collapses into the resulting crater, while the survivors of the battle escape in a [[school bus]]. The final scene, of the surviving characters surveying the crater and then talking blithely about trivial day-to-day matters prompts Giles to comment "The world is doomed," echoing the same comment he made in a similar situation in the first season.

:''Main articles: [[List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer characters|List of ''Buffy'' characters]], [[List of minor Buffy the Vampire Slayer characters|''Buffy'' minor characters]], [[List of Buffyverse villains and supernatural beings|List of ''Buffy'' villains]], and [[Scooby Gang (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)]].

===Main characters===
[[Buffy Summers]] (played by [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]) is "[[Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|the Slayer]]," one in a long line of young women chosen by [[destiny|fate]] to battle evil forces. This mystical calling endows her with dramatically increased physical strength, endurance, agility, accelerated healing, intuition, and a limited degree of [[clairvoyance]], usually in the form of [[prophecy|prophetic]] dreams.

Buffy receives guidance from her [[Watcher (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Watcher]], [[Rupert Giles]] ([[Anthony Head|Anthony Stewart Head]]). Giles, rarely referred to by his first name (it is later revealed that in his misspent younger days he was called "Ripper"), is a member of the [[Watchers' Council]], whose job is to train and assist the Slayers. Giles researches the supernatural creatures that Buffy must face, offering insights into their origins and advice on how to defeat them.

Buffy is also helped by friends she meets at Sunnydale High: [[Willow Rosenberg]] ([[Alyson Hannigan]]) and [[Xander Harris]] ([[Nicholas Brendon]]). Willow is originally a wallflower who excels at academics, providing a contrast to Buffy's outgoing personality and less-than-stellar educational record. They share the social isolation that comes with being different, and especially from being exceptional females. As the series progresses, Willow becomes a more assertive character and a powerful witch, and comes out as a lesbian. In contrast, Xander, with no supernatural skills, provides [[comic relief]] and a grounded perspective. It is Xander who often provides the heart to the series, and in season six, becomes the hero in place of Buffy who defeats the "Big Bad." Buffy and Willow are the only characters who appear in all 144 episodes; Xander is missing in [[Conversations with Dead People|only one]].

[[File:Buffy The Vampire Slayer cast.jpg|thumb|Cast members [[Tom Lenk]], [[Emma Caulfield]], [[Alexis Denisof]], [[Alyson Hannigan]], [[Anthony Stewart Head]], and [[Michelle Trachtenberg]] with series creator [[Joss Whedon]] at the series wrap party.]]

===Supporting characters===
The cast of characters grew over the course of the series. Buffy first arrives in Sunnydale with her mother, [[Joyce Summers]] (portrayed by [[Kristine Sutherland]]), who functions as an anchor of normality in the Summers' lives even after she learns of Buffy's role in the supernatural world ("[[Becoming, Part Two]]"). Buffy's younger sister [[Dawn Summers]] ([[Michelle Trachtenberg]]) is introduced in season five.

A vampire with a soul, [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] (portrayed by [[David Boreanaz]]), is Buffy's love interest throughout the first three seasons. He leaves Buffy to make amends for his sins and to search for redemption in his own spin-off, ''[[Angel (TV series)|Angel]]''. He makes several guest appearances in the remaining seasons, including the last episode.

At Sunnydale High, Buffy meets several other students besides Willow and Xander willing to join her fight for good, an informal group eventually tagged the "[[Scooby Gang (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Scooby Gang]]" or "Scoobies." [[Cordelia Chase]] ([[Charisma Carpenter]]), the archetypal shallow cheerleader, reluctantly becomes involved, and [[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Daniel "Oz" Osbourne]] ([[Seth Green]]), a fellow student, rock guitarist and werewolf, joins the group through his relationship with Willow. [[Anya Jenkins|Anya]] ([[Emma Caulfield]]), a former [[vengeance demon]] (Anyanka) who specialized in avenging scorned women, becomes Xander's lover after losing her powers and joins the group in season four.

In Buffy's senior year at high school, she meets [[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]] ([[Eliza Dushku]]), the other current Slayer, who was brought forth when Slayer [[Kendra (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Kendra Young]] ([[Bianca Lawson]]) was killed by vampire [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]] ([[Juliet Landau]]), in season two. Although she initially fights on the side of good with Buffy and the rest of the group, she comes to stand against them and sides with [[Richard Wilkins (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Mayor Richard Wilkins]] ([[Harry Groener]]) after accidentally killing a human in season three. She reappears briefly in the fourth season, looking for vengeance, and moves to ''[[Angel (TV series)|Angel]]'' where she voluntarily goes to jail for her murders. Faith reappears in season seven of ''Buffy'', having helped Angel and crew, and fights with Buffy against The First Evil.

Buffy gathers other allies: [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] ([[James Marsters]]), a vampire, is an old companion of Angelus and one of Buffy's major enemies in early seasons, although they later become allies and lovers. At the end of season six, Spike regains his soul. Spike is known for his [[Billy Idol]]-style [[peroxide blond]] hair and his black leather coat, stolen from a previous Slayer, [[Nikki Wood]]; her son, [[Robin Wood (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Robin Wood]] ([[D. B. Woodside]]), joined the group in the final season. [[Tara Maclay]] ([[Amber Benson]]) is a fellow member of Willow's [[Wicca]] group during season four, and their friendship eventually turns into a romantic relationship. Buffy became involved personally and professionally with [[Riley Finn]] ([[Marc Blucas]]), a military operative in "[[The Initiative (Buffyverse)|the Initiative]]," which hunts demons using science and technology. The final season sees geeky wannabe-villain [[Andrew Wells]] ([[Tom Lenk]]) come to side with the Scoobies, who regard him more as a nuisance than an ally.

''Buffy'' featured dozens of recurring characters, both major and minor. For example the "Big Bad" (villain) characters were featured for at least one season (for example, [[Glorificus]] was a character who appeared in 13 episodes, spanning much of season five). Similarly, characters who allied themselves to the group and characters which attended the same institutions were sometimes featured in multiple episodes.

==Spin-offs==
''Buffy'' has inspired a range of official and unofficial works, including television shows, books, comics and games. This expansion of the series encouraged use of the term "[[Buffyverse]]" to describe the fictional universe in which ''Buffy'' and related stories take place.<ref>Walton, Andy, "[http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/TV/05/19/buffy.sidebar/ Slang-age in the Buffyverse]", ''CNN'' (February 18, 2004 ).</ref>

The franchise has inspired ''Buffy'' action figures and merchandise such as [[Buffyverse Magazines (UK)|official ''Buffy/Angel'' magazines]] and [[List of Buffyverse guidebooks|''Buffy'' companion books]]. Eden Studios has published a [[Buffyverse role-playing games|''Buffy'' role-playing game]], while [[Score Entertainment]] has released a [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Collectible Card Game|''Buffy'' Collectible Card Game]].

===Series continuation===
The storyline is currently being continued in a comic book series produced by [[Joss Whedon]] and published by [[Dark Horse Comics]].  The series, which began in 2007 with ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight]]'', followed by ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine]]'', serve as a canonical continuation of the television series.

[[Joss Whedon]] was interested in a film continuation in 1998,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117471584|author=Hontz, Jenny; Petrikin, Chris|title=Whedon, Fox vamping|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=June 5, 1998|accessdate=November 25, 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20121107181641/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117471584 |archivedate=November 7, 2012}}</ref> but such a film has yet to materialize.

===''Angel''===
{{main|Angel (TV series)}}

The [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''Angel'' was introduced in October 1999, at the start of ''Buffy'' season four. The series was created by ''Buffy'''s creator [[Joss Whedon]] in collaboration with [[David Greenwalt]]. Like ''Buffy'', it was produced by the production company [[Mutant Enemy Productions|Mutant Enemy]]. At times, it performed better in the [[Nielsen ratings]] than its parent series did.<ref name = "insightbb-buffy"/>

The series was given a darker tone focusing on the ongoing trials of Angel in Los Angeles. His character is tormented by guilt following the return of his soul, punishment for more than a century of murder and torture. During the first four seasons of the show, he works as a [[private detective]] in a fictionalized version of [[Los Angeles, California]], where he and his associates work to "help the helpless" and to restore the faith and "save the souls" of those who have lost their way. Typically, this mission involves doing battle with evil demons or demonically allied humans (primarily the law firm [[Wolfram & Hart]]), while Angel must also contend with his own violent nature. In season five, the Senior Partners of Wolfram and Hart take a bold gamble in their campaign to corrupt Angel, giving him control of their Los Angeles office. Angel accepts the deal as an opportunity to fight evil from the inside.

In addition to Boreanaz, ''Angel'' inherited ''Buffy'' regular [[Charisma Carpenter]] ([[Cordelia Chase]]). When [[Glenn Quinn]] ([[Doyle (Angel)|Doyle]]) left the series during its first season, [[Alexis Denisof]] ([[Wesley Wyndam-Pryce]]), who had been a recurring character in the last nine episodes of season three of ''Buffy'', took his place. Carpenter and Denisof were followed later by [[Mercedes McNab]] ([[Harmony Kendall]]) and [[James Marsters]] ([[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]]). Several actors and actresses who played ''Buffy'' characters made guest appearances on ''Angel'', including [[Seth Green]] ([[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Daniel "Oz" Osbourne]]), [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] ([[Buffy Summers]]), [[Eliza Dushku]] ([[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]]), [[Tom Lenk]] ([[Andrew Wells]]), [[Alyson Hannigan]] ([[Willow Rosenberg]]), [[Julie Benz]] ([[Darla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Darla]]), [[Mark Metcalf]] ([[Master (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Master]]), and [[Juliet Landau]] ([[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]]). Angel also continued to appear occasionally on ''Buffy''.

The storyline has been continued in the comic book series ''[[Angel: After the Fall]]'' published by [[IDW Publishing]] and later ''[[Angel and Faith]]'' published by [[Dark Horse Comics]].

===Expanded universe===
{{Main|Buffyverse canon|List of Buffy novels|List of Buffyverse comics}}
[[File:Long way home tpb.jpg|thumb|upright|Trade paperback cover of ''Buffy: Season Eight'' [[The Long Way Home (Buffy comic)|Volume One]], written by Joss Whedon.]]
Outside of the TV series, the Buffyverse has been officially expanded and elaborated on by authors and artists in the so-called "Buffyverse [[Expanded Universe]]." The creators of these works may or may not keep to established continuity. Similarly, writers for the TV series were under no obligation to use information which had been established by the Expanded Universe, and sometimes contradicted such continuity.

[[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]] has published the [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer comics|''Buffy'' comics]] since 1998.<ref>"[http://www.darkhorse.com/Comics/98-372-a/Buffy-the-Vampire-Slayer-1-photo-cover Buffy the Vampire Slayer#1]" ''Dark Horse Comics'' ("Buffy the Vampire Slayer #1" released September 23, 1998).</ref> In 2003, Whedon wrote an eight-issue miniseries for Dark Horse Comics titled ''[[Fray]]'', about a Slayer in the future. Following the publication of ''[[Tales of the Vampires]]'' in 2004, ''Dark Horse Comics'' halted publication on Buffyverse-related comics and graphic novels. The company produced Whedon's ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight]]'' with forty issues from March 2007 to January 2011, picking up where the television show left off—taking the place of an eighth [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] season.<ref name="ew-firstlook"/> The first story arc is also written by Whedon, and is called "[[The Long Way Home (Buffy comic)|The Long Way Home]]" which has been widely well-received, with circulation rivalling industry leaders [[DC Comics|DC]] and [[Marvel Comics|Marvel's]] top-selling titles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://comicsbeat.com/dc-comics-month-to-month-sales-april-2007/ |title=DC Comics Month-to-month Sales: April 2007 |date=June 5, 2007 |accessdate=June 4, 2007 |publisher=The Beat}}</ref> Also after "[[The Long Way Home (Buffy comic)|The Long Way Home]]" came other story arcs like Faith's return in "[[No Future for You]]" and a ''Fray'' cross-over in "[[Time of Your Life (Buffy comic)|Time of Your Life]]." Dark Horse began producing ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine]]'' in August 2011 and is planned to run for 25 issues.

[[Pocket Books]] hold the license to produce [[List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer novels|''Buffy'' novels]], of which they have published more than sixty since 1998. These sometimes flesh out background information on characters; for example, ''[[Go Ask Malice]]'' details the events that lead up to Faith arriving in Sunnydale. The most recent novels include ''[[Carnival of Souls (Buffy novel)|Carnival of Souls]]'', ''[[Blackout (Buffy novel)|Blackout]]'', ''[[Portal Through Time]]'', ''[[Bad Bargain]]'', and ''The Deathless''.

Five official [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer video games|''Buffy'' video games]] have been released on portable and home consoles.<ref name="buffygames">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/search/?qs=Buffy+the+Vampire+Slayer|title=Buffy the Vampire Slayer|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=July 22, 2008}}</ref> Most notably, ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (2002 video game)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' for Xbox in 2002 and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Chaos Bleeds|Chaos Bleeds]]'' for [[GameCube]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[PlayStation 2]] in 2003.<ref name="buffychaosbleeds">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/buffy/buffystuff/videogame/chaosbleeds.shtml|title=BBC – Buffy: Chaos Bleeds|publisher=BBC|accessdate=July 22, 2008}}</ref>

===Undeveloped spinoffs===
{{main|Undeveloped Buffy the Vampire Slayer spinoffs}}

The popularity of ''Buffy'' and ''Angel'' has led to attempts to develop more on-screen ventures in the fictional 'Buffyverse'. These projects remain undeveloped and may never be [[greenlight|greenlit]]. In 2002, two potential spinoffs were in discussion: ''[[Buffy the Animated Series]]'' and [[Undeveloped Buffyverse productions#Ripper|''Ripper'']]. ''Buffy the Animated Series'' was a proposed animated TV show based on ''Buffy''; Whedon and [[Jeph Loeb]] were to be executive producers for the show, and most of the cast from ''Buffy'' were to return to voice their characters. [[20th Century Fox Television|20th Century Fox]] showed an interest in developing and selling the show to another network. A three-minute pilot was completed in 2004, but was never picked up. Whedon revealed to ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'': "We just could not find a home for it. We had six or seven hilarious scripts from our own staff – and nobody wanted it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1889839|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070930204043/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1889839|archivedate=September 20, 2007|title=Dialogue with 'Buffy' creator Joss Whedon|author=Hockensmith, Steve|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=May 16, 2003|accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref> Neither the pilot nor the scripts have been seen outside of the entertainment industry, though writer [[Jane Espenson]] has teasingly revealed small extracts from some of her scripts for the show.<ref>Espenson, Jane, "[http://www.janeespenson.com/archives/00000095.php Reading what's been written to sound written as it's spoken]", ''Janeespenson.com'' (May 9, 2006) & "[http://www.janeespenson.com/archives/00000097.php Sorry, JVC, but it's simply true]", ''Janeespenson.com'' (May 11, 2006).</ref>

''Ripper'' was originally a proposed television show based upon the character of [[Rupert Giles]] portrayed by [[Anthony Stewart Head]]. More recent information has suggested that if ''Ripper'' were ever made, it would be a TV movie or a [[Direct-to-video|DVD movie]].<ref>''[[Buffyverse Magazines (UK)|UK Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel Magazine]]''. Titan Magazines, Issue 80, (December 2005), p19.</ref> There was little heard about the series until 2007 when Joss Whedon confirmed that talks were almost completed for a 90 minute ''Ripper'' special on the BBC<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2007/07/28/comic-con-joss-whedon-panel-report/ |title=Comic-Con: Joss Whedon panel report |publisher=Tvsquad.com |date= |accessdate=June 16, 2010}}</ref> with both Head and the BBC completely on board.

In 2003, a year after the first public discussions on ''Buffy the Animated Series'' and ''Ripper'', ''Buffy'' was nearing its end. Espenson has said that during this time spinoffs were discussed, "I think [[Marti Noxon|Marti]] talked with Joss about ''[[Undeveloped Buffyverse productions#Slayer School|Slayer School]]'' and [[Tim Minear]] talked with him about Faith on a motorcycle. I assume there was some back-and-forth pitching."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/news/buffy/2003/07/03/5522.shtml |title=Dear Jane |publisher=BBC.co.uk |date=July 3, 2003 |accessdate=March 9, 2013 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030708105652/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/news/buffy/2003/07/03/5522.shtml |archivedate=July 8, 2003}}</ref> Espenson has revealed that ''Slayer School'' might have used new slayers and potentially included [[Willow Rosenberg]], but Whedon did not think that such a spinoff felt right.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/14787 |title=Way Interesting Buffy Bits (Courtesy Jane E & Others |publisher=Ain't It Cool News |date=March 21, 2003 |accessdate=March 9, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/news/buffy/2003/03/24/3421.shtml |title=Spin-offs stop spinning |publisher=BBC.co.uk |date=March 24, 2003 |accessdate=March 9, 2013 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040405030949/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/news/buffy/2003/03/24/3421.shtml |archivedate=April 5, 2004}}</ref>

Dushku declined the pitch for a Buffyverse [[Undeveloped Buffyverse productions#Faith the Vampire Slayer|TV series based on Faith]] and instead agreed to a deal to produce ''[[Tru Calling]]''. Dushku explained to [[IGN]]: "It would have been a really hard thing to do, and not that I would not have been up for a challenge, but with it coming on immediately following ''Buffy'', I think that those would have been really big boots to fill."<ref>{{cite web |author=Kuhn, Sarah |url=http://ign.com/articles/2003/05/28/an-interview-with-eliza-dushku?page=2 |title=An Interview with Eliza Dushku |publisher=IGN |date=May 28, 2003 |accessdate=March 9, 2013}}</ref> Tim Minear explained some of the ideas behind the aborted series: "The show was basically going to be Faith meets ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]''. It would have been Faith, probably on a motorcycle, crossing the earth, trying to find her place in the world."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/news/buffy/2003/04/14/3812.shtml |title=Kung Fu Faith |publisher=BBC.co.uk |date=April 14, 2003 |accessdate=March 9, 2013 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070314055320/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/news/buffy/2003/04/14/3812.shtml |archivedate=March 14, 2007}}</ref>

Finally, during the summer of 2004 after the end of ''Angel'', a movie about [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] was proposed.<ref>[http://whedonesque.com/comments/3877 Spike TV movie on the cards?], ''Whedonesque.com'' (May 9, 2004). Marsters is indirectly quoted about the possibility of a Spike movie in May 2004.</ref> The movie would have been directed by Tim Minear and starred Marsters and [[Amy Acker]] and featured Alyson Hannigan.<ref>Saney, Daniel, "[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a24796/whedon-eyes-willow-for-spike-movie.html Whedon eyes Willow for Spike movie]", ''Digitalspy.co.uk'' (September 28, 2005). Originally reported by ''Tvguide.com''.</ref> Outside the 2006 [[Saturn Award]]s, Whedon announced that he had pitched the concept to various bodies but had yet to receive any feedback.<ref>"[http://whedonesque.com/comments/10310 Video interview with Joss from the Saturn Awards]", ''Whedonesque.com'' (February 15, 2006). Originally reported by ''Iesb.net''.</ref>

In September 2008, ''Sci-Fi Wire'' ran an interview with Sarah Michelle Gellar in which she said she would not rule out returning to her most iconic role: "Never say never," she said. "One of the reasons the original ''Buffy'' movie did not really work on the big screen–and people blamed Kristy, but that's not what it was–the story was better told over a long arc," Gellar said. "And I worry about Buffy as a 'beginning, middle and end' so quickly.&nbsp;... You show me a script; you show me that it works, and you show me that [the] audience can accept that, [and] I'd probably be there. Those are what my hesitations are."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whedon.info/Sarah-Michelle-Gellar-New-Buffy.html|title=Sarah Michelle Gellar - New "Buffy" Movie - A Film Wouldn't Work|publisher=Sci-Fi Wire|date=January 22, 2008|accessdate=September 10, 2010}}</ref>

==Cultural impact==
[[File:Anthony Stewart Head and Nicholas Brendon Aug 2004.jpg|250px|thumb|Anthony Stewart Head and Nicholas Brendon at the Oakland Super SlayerCon fan convention]]
''Buffy'' has had a cultural impact on a number of media. It has impacted [[television studies]] and inspired fan-made films, it has been parodied and referenced, and has influenced other television series.

===Academia===
{{main|Buffy studies}}

''Buffy'' is notable for attracting the interest of scholars of popular culture as a subset of [[popular culture studies]]. Some academic settings include the show as a topic of literary study and analysis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Entertainment/20040529/scholars_buffy_040529/ |title=Scholars lecture on 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' |publisher=CTV News |date=May 29, 2004 |accessdate=March 9, 2013 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110604122828/http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Entertainment/20040529/scholars_buffy_040529/ |archivedate=June 4, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://metro.co.uk/2006/05/16/study-buffy-at-university-79726/ |title=Study Buffy at university |publisher=Metro.co.uk |date=May 16, 2006 |accessdate=March 9, 2013}}</ref> [[National Public Radio]] describes ''Buffy'' as having a "special following among academics, some of whom have staked a claim in what they call 'Buffy Studies.'"<ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=3850482 Ulaby, Neda], '[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1262180 – 'Buffy Studies']", ''National Public Radio'' (May 13, 2003)</ref> Though not widely recognized as a distinct discipline, the term "Buffy studies" is commonly used amongst the peer-reviewed academic ''Buffy''-related writings.<ref>Lavery, David, & Wilcox, Rhonda V., [http://slayageonline.com/ ''Slayageonline.com''] (2001–). The term is in use from the subtitle of ''Slayage: The Online International Journal of Buffy Studies'', and thus has become used in essays by those who contribute to scholarship relating to ''Buffy''.</ref> The response to this attention has had its critics. For example, Jes Battis, who authored ''[[Blood Relations: Chosen Families in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel|Blood Relations in Buffy and Angel]]'', admits that study of the Buffyverse "invokes an uneasy combination of enthusiasm and ire" and meets "a certain amount of disdain from within the halls of the academy."<ref>Battis, Jes, [[Blood Relations: Chosen Families in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel|''Blood Relations'']], ''McFarland & Company'' (June 2005), page 9.</ref> Nonetheless ''Buffy'' eventually led to the publication of around twenty books and hundreds of articles examining the themes of the show from a wide range of disciplinary perspectives including [[sociology]], [[Speech Communication]], [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], and [[women's studies]].<ref>See:

The series, which employed [[popular culture|pop culture]] references as a frequent humorous device, has itself become a frequent pop culture reference in video games, comics and television shows and has been frequently parodied and spoofed.

''Buffy'' helped put [[The WB Television Network|The WB]] on the ratings map, but by the time the series landed on [[UPN]] in 2001, viewing figures had fallen. The series' high came during the third season, with 5.3 million viewers. This was probably due to the fact that both Gellar and Hannigan had hit movies out during the season (''[[Cruel Intentions]]'' and ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'' respectively). The series' low was in season one at 3.7 million. Season seven almost equaled that, with 3.8 million. The show's series finale "[[Chosen (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Chosen]]" pulled in a season high of 4.9&nbsp;million viewers on the UPN network.<ref name="s7 ratings">{{cite web |url=http://tv.zap2it.com/news/tvnewsdaily.html?31651 |title='Buffy' Finale Stakes Strong Ratings for UPN |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030524173301/http://tv.zap2it.com/news/tvnewsdaily.html?31651 |archivedate=May 24, 2003 |date=May 21, 2003 |accessdate=December 29, 2012 |publisher=Zap2it}}</ref>

''Buffy'' did not compete with shows on the main four networks ([[CBS]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]), but The WB was impressed with the young audience that the show was bringing in. Because of this, The WB ordered a full season of 22 episodes for the series' second season. Beginning with the episode "[[Innocence (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Innocence]]," which was watched by 8.2&nbsp;million people, ''Buffy'' was moved from Monday at 9:00&nbsp;pm to launch The WB's new night of programming on Tuesday. Due to its large success in that time slot, it remained on Tuesdays at 8:00&nbsp;pm for the remainder of its original run. With its new timeslot on The WB, the show quickly climbed to the top of The WB ratings and became one of their highest-rated shows for the remainder of its time on the network. The show always placed in the top 3, usually only coming in behind ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]''. Between seasons three and five, ''Buffy'' flip-flopped with ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' and ''[[Charmed]]'' as the network's second highest-rated show.

In the 2001–2002 season, the show had moved to UPN after a negotiation dispute with The WB. While it was still one of their highest rated shows on their network, The WB felt that the show had already peaked and was not worth giving a salary increase to the cast and crew. UPN on the other hand, had strong faith in the series and picked up it for a two-season renewal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2001-04-23/entertainment/buffy_1_dean-valentine-key-upn-affiliates-buffy?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ |title='Buffy' picks up stakes, leaves WB for UPN |publisher=CNN |date=April 23, 2001 |accessdate=December 29, 2012}}</ref> UPN dedicated a two-hour premiere to the series to help re-launch it. The relaunching had effect, as the season premiere attracted the second highest rating of the series, with 7.7 million viewers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mania.com/top-ten-genre-broadcast-tv-ratings-oct-17_article_30089.html |title=Top Ten Genre Broadcast TV ratings (Oct. 1-7) |publisher=Mania.com |date=October 11, 2001 |accessdate=June 26, 2011 |author=Kurtz, Frank}}</ref>

===Impact on television===
Commentators of the entertainment industry including ''Allmovie'', ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' have cited ''Buffy'' as "influential."<ref>For example: Dillard, Brian J., "[http://www.allmovie.com/work/174873 <nowiki>Buffy the Vampire Slayer [TV Series]</nowiki>]", ''Allmovie'' (2003 or after): "wildly influential cult hit." Harrington, Richard, "[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/29/AR2005092900594.html Joss Whedon's New Frontier]", ''The Washington Post'' (September 30, 2005): "One of the best, most influential, genre-defining television series in decades." Kit, Borys, "[http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/7224008/ns/today-entertainment/ Whedon lassos 'Wonder' helm for Warners]", ''The Hollywood Reporter'', requires subscription (March 17, 2005): "the influential WB Network/UPN drama series"</ref> Autumn 2003 saw several new shows going into production in the U.S. that featured strong females who are forced to come to terms with supernatural power or destiny while trying to maintain a normal life.<ref name="Salem">Salem, Rob, "[http://www.whedon.info/article.php3?id_article=1319&img= The season to talk to dead people]", ''Thestar.com'', transcribed to ''Whedon.info'' (August 25, 2003)</ref> These post-''Buffy'' shows include ''[[Dead Like Me]]'', ''[[Joan of Arcadia]]'' and ''[[Teen Wolf (2011 TV series)|Teen Wolf]]''. [[Bryan Fuller]], the creator of ''Dead Like Me'', said that "''Buffy'' showed that young women could be in situations that were both fantastic and relatable, and instead of shunting women off to the side, it puts them at the center."<ref name="Salem" /> In the United Kingdom, the lessons learned from the impact of ''Buffy'' influenced the revived ''[[Doctor Who]]'' series (2005–present),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2005/03/12/doctor-who-report-new-theme-music |title=Doctor Who Report: New Theme Music? |publisher=IGN |date=March 11, 2005 |accessdate=March 9, 2013}}</ref> and executive producer [[Russell T Davies]] has said:

{{quote|''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' showed the whole world, and an entire sprawling industry, that writing monsters and demons and end-of-the world is not hack-work, it can challenge the best. Joss Whedon raised the bar for every writer—not just genre/niche writers, but every single one of us.<ref>Moore, Candace, "[http://www.afterelton.com/TV/2005/5/drwho.html John Barrowman Plays Bisexual Time Traveler on New Dr. Who]", ''Afterelton.com'' (May 19, 2005).</ref>}}
As well as influencing ''Doctor Who'', ''Buffy'' influenced its spinoff series ''[[Torchwood]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Stokes |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Stokes |coauthors=Hugo, Simon |year=2008 |month=March |title=Like a Kid in a Candy Store |journal=[[Torchwood Magazine]] |issue=2 |pages=64–65 |publisher=[[Titan Magazines]]
|issn=17560950}}</ref>

Several ''Buffy'' alumni have gone on to write for or create other shows. Such endeavors include ''[[Tru Calling]]'' ([[Douglas Petrie]], [[Jane Espenson]] and lead actress [[Eliza Dushku]]), ''[[Wonderfalls]]'' ([[Tim Minear]]), ''[[Point Pleasant (TV series)|Point Pleasant]]'' ([[Marti Noxon]]), ''[[Jake 2.0]]'' ([[David Greenwalt]]), ''[[The Inside]]'' (Tim Minear), ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' ([[Steven S. DeKnight]]), ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'' ([[Jane Espenson]]), and ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' ([[Drew Goddard]] and [[David Fury]]).

Meanwhile, the [[Parents Television Council]] complained of efforts to "deluge their young viewing audiences with adult themes."<ref>"[http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/reports/top10bestandworst/2002/main.asp The 2001–2002 Top 10 Best and Worst Shows on Network TV]" & "[http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/reports/stateindustryviolence/main.asp TV Bloodbath: Violence on Prime Time Broadcast TV]" ''Parentstv.org'' (2002 & 2003 respectively).</ref> The U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), however, rejected the Council's indecency complaint concerning the violent sex scene between Buffy and Spike in "[[Smashed (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Smashed]]."<ref>[http://www.fcc.gov/eb/Orders/2004/FCC-04-196A1.html FCC, In the Matter of Complaints Against Various Broadcast Licensees Regarding Their Airing of the UPN Network Program "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" on November 20, 2001].</ref> The BBC, however, chose to censor some of the more controversial sexual content when it was shown on the pre-[[Watershed (television)|watershed]] 6:45&nbsp;pm slot.<ref>[http://slayageonline.com/essays/slayage8/Burr.htm Burr, Vivien. "Buffy vs. the BBC: Moral Questions and How to Avoid Them"].</ref>

==Series information==
The first season was introduced as a mid-season replacement for the short-lived night-time soap opera ''[[Savannah (TV series)|Savannah]]'', and therefore was made up of only 12 episodes. Each subsequent season was built up of 22 episodes. Discounting the [[Unaired Buffy the Vampire Slayer pilot|unaired ''Buffy'' pilot]], the seven seasons make up [[List of Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes|a total of 144 ''Buffy'' episodes]] aired between 1997 and 2003.
