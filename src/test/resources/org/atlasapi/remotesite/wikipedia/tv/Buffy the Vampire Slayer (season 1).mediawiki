The '''first season''' of the television series '''''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''''' premiered on March 10, 1997 as a [[midseason replacement]] on [[The WB Television Network]] and concluded its 12-episode season on June 2, 1997. The first season aired on Mondays at 9:00&nbsp;pm ET.

== Plot ==
The first season exemplifies the "high school as hell" concept. [[Buffy Summers]] has just moved to [[Sunnydale]] after burning down her old school's gym and hopes to escape her Slayer duties. Her plans are complicated by [[Rupert Giles]], her new [[Watcher (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Watcher]], who reminds her of the inescapable presence of evil. Sunnydale High is built atop a [[Hellmouth (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Hellmouth]], a portal to demon dimensions that attracts supernatural phenomena to the area. Buffy meets two schoolmates, [[Xander Harris]] and [[Willow Rosenberg]], who help her fight evil through the series. She also gets a love interest in the form of [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]], a vampire who has a soul. They soon become known as the "[[Scooby Gang (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Scoobies]]". Together they must prevent [[Master (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Master]], an ancient and especially threatening vampire, from opening the Hellmouth and taking over Sunnydale.

While befriending Buffy on her first day, both Willow and Xander have motives to fight. Xander's motive to fighting alongside Buffy was the loss of his friend Jesse, who was turned into a vampire by The Masters' minions. Xander soon kills Jesse. Willow however was more timid and fiercely scared of monsters. They both soon become Buffy's most loyal sidekicks. There is some romantic tension between them as Xander has a crush on Buffy while he is oblivious of Willow's affections for him. The Scoobies distrust Angel but warm up to him as the season progresses.

Buffy and her friends often clash with [[Cordelia Chase]], who attempted to befriend Buffy on her first day, but Buffy didn't like the way she treated Willow. Throughout the season, Cordelia was often at odds with Buffy and her friends but near the end of the season, she becomes aware of the supernatural world around her and helps Buffy.

In the earlier episodes, Buffy and Angel encounter The Master's favorite minion [[Darla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Darla]], who was the vampire who sired Angel. Darla is soon killed much to The Master's anger, but The Master gains a new ally in the form of the [[Anointed One (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Anointed One]], a child like minion who has a major role in opening the Hellmouth.

In the season finale, Buffy learns of a prophecy involving her death at the hands of The Master. Just as The Master begins his plot, Buffy finally confronts him. The Master bites Buffy and leaves her to drown in a shallow pool. Buffy recovers via CPR by Xander and confronts The Master again on the school roof. After a final stand off, The Master is impaled and killed on a piece of wood after falling through the Sunnydale High skylight. After saving the world, Buffy and her new friends go to a party.

== Origins ==
Writer [[Joss Whedon]] says that "Rhonda the Immortal Waitress was really the first incarnation of the ''Buffy'' concept, just the idea of some woman who seems to be completely insignificant who turns out to be extraordinary."<ref>"''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'': Television with a Bite" ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer DVDs#Season 6|Buffy sixth season DVD set]]'', Disc six (2003), at time 02:15.</ref> This early, unproduced idea evolved into ''Buffy'', which Whedon developed to invert the Hollywood formula of "the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every [[horror film|horror movie]]."<ref name="blondegirl">Billson, Anne, ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (BFI TV Classics)]]''. [[British Film Institute]] (December 5, 2005), pp. 24–25.</ref> Whedon wanted "to subvert that idea and create someone who was a hero."<ref name=blondegirl /> He explained, "The very first mission statement of the show was the joy of female power: having it, using it, sharing it."<ref>Gottlieb, Allie, "[http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/09.26.02/buffy1-0239.html Buffy's Angels]", ''Metroactive.com'' (September 26, 2002).</ref>

The idea was first visited through Whedon's script for the [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (film)|1992 movie ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'']], which featured [[Kristy Swanson]] in the title role. The director, [[Fran Rubel Kuzui]], saw it as a "pop culture comedy about what people think about [[vampire]]s."<ref>Havens, Candace, ''Joss Whedon: The Genius Behind Buffy'' Benbella Books (May 1, 2003), p. 51. Fran Kuzui also discussed ''Buffy'' in Golden, Christopher, & Holder, Nancy, [[List of Buffyverse guidebooks#"Watcher's Guides"|''Watcher's Guide Vol. 1'']]. [[Simon & Schuster]] (October 1, 1998), pp. 247–248.</ref> Whedon disagreed: "I had written this scary film about an empowered woman, and they turned it into a broad comedy. It was crushing."<ref>Havens, Candace, ''Joss Whedon: The Genius Behind Buffy'' Benbella Books (May 1, 2003), p. 23.</ref> The script was praised within the industry,<ref>Brundage, James, [http://www.filmcritic.com/reviews/1992/buffy-the-vampire-slayer/?OpenDocument "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" film review]. ''Filmcritic.com'' (1999). An example of the praise given to the script and dialogue behind the ''Buffy'' movie.</ref> but the movie was not.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/buffy_the_vampire_slayer/|title=''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' at ''Rottentomatoes.com''}}</ref>

Several years later, [[Gail Berman]], a Fox executive, approached Whedon to develop his ''Buffy'' concept into a television series.<ref>Golden, Christopher, and Holder, Nancy, [[List of Buffyverse guidebooks#"Watcher's Guides"|''Watcher's Guide Vol. 1'']]. [[Simon & Schuster]] (October 1, 1998), pp. 249–250</ref> Whedon explained that "They said, 'Do you want to do a show?' And I thought, 'High school as a horror movie.' And so the metaphor became the central concept behind ''Buffy'', and that's how I sold it."<ref>'Said, SF', "[http://www.shebytches.com/SFSaidgb.html Interview with Joss Whedon by SF Said]", ''Shebytches.com'' (2005).</ref> The [[supernatural]] elements in the series stood as [[metaphor]]s for personal anxieties associated with [[adolescence]] and young adulthood.<ref>{{cite book| author = Wilcox, Rhonda V.| coauthors = David Lavery| title = Fighting the Forces: What's at Stake in Buffy the Vampire Slayer| chapter = Introduction| publisher = Rowman & Littlefield| date= April 2002| url= http://books.google.com/?id=amKx_wH-PDYC&pg=PR17&dq=buffy+forces+introduction| pages = xix| nopp = true| isbn = 978-0-7425-1681-6}}</ref> Whedon went on to write and partly fund a 25-minute [[Unaired Buffy the Vampire Slayer pilot|non-broadcast pilot]]<ref>Topping, Keith [[List of Buffyverse guidebooks#Keith Topping|"Slayer"]]. [[Virgin Publishing]], (December 1, 2004), p. 7</ref> that was shown to networks and eventually sold to [[The WB Television Network]]. The latter promoted the premiere with a series of ''History of the Slayer'' clips,<ref>"[http://www.tvobscurities.com/articles/forgotten_buffy/ Television Obscurities - Buffy, The Vampire Slayer: Forgotten Premiere Trailer]" ''Tvobscurities.com'' (July 16, 2003).</ref> and the [[Welcome to the Hellmouth|first episode]] aired on March 10, 1997.
