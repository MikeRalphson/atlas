The '''fifth season''' of the television series '''''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''''' premiered on September 26, 2000 on [[The WB Television Network]] and concluded its 22-episode season on May 22, 2001. It maintained its previous timeslot, airing Tuesdays at 8:00 pm ET. This was the final season to air on The WB before it moved to [[UPN]]; The WB billed the season five finale as the "''The WB'' [[series finale]]".

== Plot ==
In the season premiere, the famous vampire [[Dracula (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Count Dracula]] makes an appearance in [[Sunnydale]] in search of [[Buffy Summers|Buffy]]. He then bites Buffy in the same place where she was bitten by [[Master (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Master]] and [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] ("[[Prophecy Girl]]" and "[[Graduation Day (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Graduation Day]]"). Buffy breaks free from his will and Dracula is defeated and staked.

Season five introduces Buffy's younger "sister", [[Dawn Summers|Dawn]], who suddenly appears in Buffy's life. Although she is new to the series, to the characters it is as if she has always been there. 

Meanwhile, [[Glory (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Glorificus]], or Glory, a hell-goddess who was exiled from her dimension after a war, has come to Earth. She can only remain there by being connected to her human form, known as [[Ben (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Ben]]. Glory takes the form of a beautiful young woman, with her powers still intact as long as she maintains her strength through draining people of their sanity. She begins searching for a "Key" that will allow her to return to her Hell dimension by blurring the lines between dimensions, and in the process unleashing Hell on Earth. At the beginning of the season Glory and Ben are vying for control, alternating who possesses the body they share; later the line between them begins to blur and they experience each other's emotions and memories.

It is discovered that the Key's protectors had turned the Key into a human biologically related to the Summers -- Buffy's new sister Dawn.  At the same time they implanted in her family and friends lifelong memories of her. The [[Watchers' Council]], with which Buffy had previously cut ties, aids in Buffy's research of Glory, and she and Giles are both reinstated by the Council. Due to problems with her [[Joyce Summers|mother]], Buffy suspects Dawn may be harming Joyce, but they discover that they were caused by a [[brain tumor]]. As a result Buffy, and especially Joyce, begin to accept Dawn as a true part of the family. Upon learning of Joyce's tumor, Buffy leaves her dorm to take care of her mother.

[[Riley Finn|Riley]] leaves early in the season after concluding that Buffy does not love him, joining a military demon-hunting operation, while [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]], still implanted with the Initiative chip, realizes he is in love with Buffy and begins fighting alongside the Scoobies. Buffy continually refuses his advances and alienates him. 

[[Xander Harris|Xander]]'s girlfriend [[Anya Jenkins]] begins to experience deeper human emotions, both negative and positive, such as a love for money. Anya is hired by [[Rupert Giles|Giles]] and works alongside him at [[The Magic Box (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Magic Box]].

Glory attacks [[Willow Rosenberg|Willow]]'s girlfriend [[Tara Maclay]], draining her of her sanity. In a rage, Willow attacks Glory and is nearly killed, but Buffy intervenes. 

Spike commissions [[Warren Mears]] to build a robot version of Buffy, later known as the [[Buffybot#Buffybot|Buffybot]]. This greatly angers Buffy, but she soon softens after Spike is tortured by Glory yet refuses to reveal that Dawn is the Key. After this ordeal, Buffy warms up to Spike, promising she won't forget what he has done for her and inviting him back into her life.

Near the end of the season, Joyce dies of an aneurysm, devastating Dawn and Buffy. Glory discovers that Dawn is the Key and kidnaps her. In a moment alone, Xander proposes to Anya. Buffy and her friends track Glory and Dawn to a tower built by Glory's minions. At the time of the ritual, Glory uses Dawn's blood to open the portal between dimensions, but she is distracted by the Scoobies' intervention. Willow takes Tara's sanity from Glory and gives it back, severely weakening Glory. After overpowering Glory, Buffy tells her to leave Sunnydale or die. When Glory reverts to Ben, Giles kills Ben to prevent her return. Dawn wants to sacrifice herself to save the world, but Buffy realizes that because she is related to Dawn, her blood can also close the portal.  She realizes the meaning of the First Slayer's message—"Death is your gift"—and sacrifices her own life to save Dawn's and close the portal. Buffy's friends mourn her death and praise her with the inscription "She saved the world a lot".

=== Crossovers with ''Angel'' ===
The fifth season of ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' aired along with the [[Angel (season 2)|second season]] of ''[[Angel (TV series)|Angel]]''. Both shows retained their timeslots on [[The WB Television Network]], airing on Tuesdays at 8:00 PM ET and 9:00 PM ET respectively.

The ''Buffy'' episode "[[Fool for Love (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Fool for Love]]" is a companion to the ''Angel'' episode "[[Darla (Angel episode)|Darla]]". Both episodes feature multiple flashbacks to the history of [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] ([[James Marsters]]) and [[Darla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Darla]] ([[Julie Benz]]), shown from their respective viewpoints. [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] ([[David Boreanaz]]) and [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]] ([[Juliet Landau]]) also appear in both episodes. Both episodes feature a same scene – one from the point of view of Spike and the other from Angel, Darla, and Drusilla.

''Buffy'' recurring character Drusilla makes her first present-tense appearance on ''Angel'' in the episode "[[The Trial (Angel)|The Trial]]". She returns to Sunnydale in her final present-tense appearance in the episode "[[Crush (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Crush]]".

Angel visits Buffy in the episode "[[Forever (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Forever]]" to comfort her after he learns her [[Joyce Summers|mother]] died.

''Buffy'' recurring character [[Harmony Kendall]] ([[Mercedes McNab]]) visits L.A. in the ''Angel'' episode "[[Disharmony (Angel)|Disharmony]]". Harmony would later appear in the fifth season of ''Angel'' and become a main character. [[Willow Rosenberg|Willow]] ([[Alyson Hannigan]]) also appears in the episode in a conversation with [[Cordelia Chase|Cordelia]] ([[Charisma Carpenter]]) over the phone.

Willow comes to L.A. in the ''Angel'' season two finale, "[[There's No Place Like Plrtz Glrb]]" to deliver the news to Angel that [[The Gift (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Buffy had died]].

== Reception ==

[[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama|Best Actress – Television Series Drama]]. [[Joss Whedon]] was nominated for a [[Nebula Award]] for [[Nebula Award for Best Script|Best Script]] for "[[The Body (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Body]]".

The episode "The Body" was particularly highly acclaimed by critics. David Bianculli in the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' commends the acting abilities of Sarah Michelle Gellar, Michelle Trachtenberg, Alyson Hannigan, and Amber Benson. "The Body", according to Bianculli is "[[Emmy Award|Emmy]]-worthy ... It also will haunt you—but not in the normal way associated with this still-evolving, still-achieving series."<ref>Bianculli, David (February 27, 2001). "Super Yet Natural: Tonight's 'Buffy' is a gem of realism", ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' (New York), p. 87.</ref> Television critic Alesia Redding and editor Joe Vince of the ''[[South Bend Tribune]]'' write, "I was riveted by this show ... This isn't just one of the best ''Buffy'' episodes of all time. It's one of the best episodes of TV of all time." Redding adds, "If you watch this incredible episode and don't recognize it as great TV, you're hopeless&nbsp;... A 'fantasy' show delivers the most stark and realistic take on death I've ever seen, deftly depicting how a loved one who dies suddenly becomes 'the body'." <ref>Redding, Alesia (May 25, 2003). "Slayed to rest ; A few tweaks might have let 'Buffy' go into TV history with a little more bite", ''[[South Bend Tribune]]'' (Schurz Communications).</ref>

Gareth McLean in ''[[The Guardian]]'' rejected the notion that ''Buffy'' is similar to other "schmaltzy American teen show(s)" like ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'': "This episode was a brave, honest and wrenching portrayal of death and loss. The way this was handled by Joss Whedon ... was ingenious. Time slowed down and the feeling of numbness was palpable as Buffy and her gang tried to come to terms with Joyce's death." McLean especially appreciated the small details of Buffy protecting Joyce's dignity and the confusion shown by the characters. He concludes, "Joyce may be dead but long live ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer''."<ref>McLean, Gareth (April 21, 2001). "Review: Last night's TV: A real death in Buffy land", ''[[The Guardian]]'' (London; Guardian Media Group), p. 19.</ref>

At [[Salon.com]], Joyce Millman wrote, "there hasn't been a finer hour of drama on TV this year than ... 'The Body' ... You have to hand it to the writers; Joyce's demise came as a complete surprise. In that instant, Buffy's childhood officially ends. Even if ''Buffy'' gets stiffed in every other Emmy category this year, 'The Body' should convince the nominating committee that Gellar is for real ... I can't remember the last time I saw a more wrenching portrayal of the shock of loss."<ref>Millman, Joyce (March 21, 2001). "[http://www.salon.com/entertainment/col/mill/2001/03/12/buffy_mom The death of Buffy's mom], Salon.com. Retrieved on June 14, 2010.</ref> Andrew Gilstrap at [[PopMatters]] declares it "possibly the finest hour of television I've seen, bar none&nbsp;...  It is an incredibly moving episode, one that finally admits that you don't walk away from death unscathed. It also shows that, for all the group's slaying experience, they really weren't prepared for death when it stole a loved one."<ref>Gilstrap, Andrew (June 10, 2002) [http://www.popmatters.com/tv/reviews/b/buffy-the-vampire-slayer3.shtml Death and the Single Girl: Buffy Grows Up], Pop Matters.
