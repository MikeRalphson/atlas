On 24 November 2008, 14 league games into the [[2008–09 in English football|2008–09 season]], Fàbregas was named as the successor to [[William Gallas]] as club captain.<ref>[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=595659&sec=uefachampionsleague&cc=4716 Fabregas replaces Gallas as Arsenal skipper], ESPNsoccernet, 24 November 2008, accessed 25 November 2008.</ref><ref>[http://www.thesportreview.com/tsr/2008/11/captain-cescs-appointment-is-no-surpise/ Captain Cesc's appointment is no surprise], The Sport Review, 26 November 2008, accessed 22 May 2009.</ref> However, just as Arsenal were getting back into the title race after a poor start to the season, the Spaniard was ruled out for four months after sustaining a knee injury against Liverpool.<ref>[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=604874&sec=england&cc=4716 Injured Fabregas ruled out for 3–4 months], ESPNsoccernet, 23 December 2008, accessed 24 December 2008.</ref> The Gunners eventually finished the season without any silverware, coming in fourth in the league and being knocked out at the semi-finals of the [[UEFA Champions League 2008–09|2008–09 Champions League campaign]].<ref>[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/team/stats?id=359&season=2008&league=eng.1&cc=4716 2008/2009 English Premier League: Statistics], ESPNsoccernet, accessed 1 July 2009.</ref><ref>[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=266495&cc=4716&league=UEFA.CHAMPIONS Arsenal 1 – 3 Manchester United], ESPNsoccernet, 29 April 2009, accessed 1 July 2009.</ref> In tandem with Arsenal's policy to groom its young players, the team that Fàbregas led into the new season consisted mostly of the same young nucleus as before, with the likes of [[Nicklas Bendtner]], [[Gaël Clichy]], [[Abou Diaby]], [[Denílson Pereira Neves|Denílson]], [[Samir Nasri]], [[Alexandre Song]] and [[Theo Walcott]] in tow.

In the opening league game of [[2009–10 in English football|2009–10 season]], Fàbregas scored a brace and managed two assists in Arsenal's 6–1 away win against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].<ref>[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=269878&cc=5901&league=ENG.1 Gunners crush Toffees], ESPNsoccernet, 15 August 2009, accessed 18 August 2009.</ref> Arsenal went on to secure qualification for the [[UEFA Champions League 2009–10|2009–10 Champions League campaign]] by beating [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] over two legs, but their early momentum to the season was disrupted by consecutive league game losses to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. The team bounced back strongly after this setback, and with Fàbregas being prolific in scoring and setting up his teammates, it went unbeaten in the next 13 games. Despite suffering four league losses even before mid-season approached, Arsenal managed to lead the league standings after 22 games. On 31 March 2010, in the Champions League first leg of the quarter-final against Barcelona, Fàbregas suffered a leg fracture before scoring the equalising goal in the game which ended 2–2.<ref name=fract>[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=764753&sec=england&cc=5901 Fabregas out for six weeks with leg fracture], ESPNsoccernet, 1 April 2010, accessed 2 April 2010.</ref> Arsenal, who were four points behind league leaders Manchester United, were deprived of their captain for the remaining six league games of the season;<ref name=fract/> they were subsequently eliminated by Barcelona in the Champions League, and fell out of the league title race.

Before the start of the [[2010–11 in English football|2010–11 season]], there was once again intense media speculation about the Spaniard's future, and in June 2010, a €35&nbsp;million bid from Barcelona was rejected.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/8717785.stm Arsenal reject Barcelona's bid for Cesc Fabregas], BBC Sport, 2 June 2010, accessed 15 June 2010.</ref><ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1282129/Barcelona-switch-tactics-Cesc-Fabregas-bid-Arsenal-negotiating-table.html Barcelona switch tactics over Cesc Fabregas in bid to get Arsenal to the negotiating table], ''The Daily Mail'', 28 May 2010, accessed 22 June 2010.</ref><ref>[http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/noticies/futbol/temporada09-10/06/04/n100604111383.html Laporta: Lines of communication open over Cesc], fcbarcelona.cat, 4 June 2010, accessed 27 June 2010.</ref> The 2010–11 season turned out to be an extremely competitive one in the Premier League; even though Arsenal had lost five games before mid-season, they were jostling for pole position with Manchester United and Manchester City.<ref>Roger, Martins, [http://sports.yahoo.com/soccer/news?slug=ro-eplmidtermgrades122910 "EPL midseason surprises and disappointments"], Yahoo!

Arsenal remained in contention for the league title until a series of draws in the final third of the season caused them to fall too far behind league leaders Manchester United; they ended the season fourth. The [[2011–12 in English football|following season]] was once again marked by uncertainty. Barcelona made several bids for Fàbregas, while Nasri, Arsenal's star performer the previous campaign, was courted by Manchester City.

Fàbregas joined a team that had won three [[List of Spanish football champions|La Liga titles]] in a row and two Champions League titles in three years, and one that featured the likes of [[Lionel Messi]], Xavi Hernández, Andrés Iniesta and [[David Villa]]. He made his debut in the second leg of the [[Supercopa de España]], coming on as a substitute against [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]].

Fàbregas then spent the majority of October sidelined with a hamstring injury picked up on international duty.

Fàbregas got another brace in a 4–0 victory against [[CA Osasuna]] in the [[2011–12 Copa del Rey|Copa del Rey]]. He also scored in the semi-final of the competition against Valencia to help Barcelona to the final with a 3–1 win on aggregate. He kept a regular run in the Barcelona side for the rest of the season, including appearances in both semi-final legs of the 3–2 aggregate defeat to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the Champions League, and a substitute appearance in the 3–0 victory against Athletic Bilbao in the [[2012 Copa del Rey Final|Copa del Rey final]].

Fàbregas ended his first season at Barcelona by winning the [[2011–12 Copa del Rey]], [[2011 Supercopa de España]], [[2011 UEFA Super Cup]] and the [[2011 FIFA Club World Cup]], notching 15 goals and 20 assists in 48 appearances and four best midfielder awards.

==== 2012–13 season ====

Fàbregas ended his long goal drought for his club when he scored his first league goals of the season with a brace against [[Sevilla FC]] in a 3–2 away victory.

==== 2009 Confederations Cup ====

After missing out for several months due to his injury, Fàbregas regained his place as a regular in [[Vicente del Bosque]]'s squad. In June, he was named in the team for the [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup]]. He scored his second international goal in a 5–0 win against [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand]] in the competition's group stage.<ref>[http://www.fifa.com/confederationscup/matches/round=250116/match=66203/summary.html Torres stars in Spanish stroll], FIFA, accessed 15 June 2009.</ref> In the semi-finals against the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] (which Fàbregas started), Spain suffered a shock 2–0 loss, and its 15-game winning streak came to an end.<ref>[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=270153&cc=4716 Altidore's goal leads U.S. to stunning upset], ESPNsoccernet, 24 June 2009, accessed 26 June 2009.</ref>

==== 2010 World Cup ====

[[File:Cesc Fàbregas and Giorgio Chiellini Euro 2012 final.jpg|thumb|Fàbregas during the [[UEFA Euro 2012 Final]]]]
Fàbregas was selected as a part of del Bosque's 23-man squad for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8695232.stm Spain omit Marcos Senna from 2010 World Cup squad], BBC Sport, 20 May 2010, accessed 22 May 2010.</ref> With del Bosque preferring a starting midfield of [[Sergio Busquets]], [[Xabi Alonso]], [[Xavi]] and [[Andrés Iniesta]], Fàbregas did not start in any of Spain's games in the competition. He featured as a substitute in four of their seven matches, in which Spain lost their opening game before winning the next six en route to [[2010 FIFA World Cup Final|the final]]. In the Final itself, Fàbregas set up the extra-time winner for Iniesta to win Spain the World Cup for the first time in their history.<ref>[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=264123&cc=4716&league=FIFA.WORLD&ver=global Iniesta sinks Dutch with late strike], ESPNsoccernet, 11 July 2010, accessed 13 July 2010.</ref>

==== UEFA Euro 2012 ====

Fàbregas was selected as a part of del Bosque's 23-man squad for [[UEFA Euro 2012]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18227019

Fàbregas started in the front three of a 4–3–3 formation against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in Spain's opening [[UEFA Euro 2012 Group C|Group C]] match. In the 64th minute he scored the equaliser after Italy had taken the lead in the 61st minute; the game finished in a 1–1 draw.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18180099|title=Spain 1–1 Italy |date=10 June 2012|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=11 June 2012 }}</ref> He then scored his second goal of the tournament in the group stage match against [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Ireland]]. When Spain faced [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in the semi-finals and the game remained scoreless at the end of extra time, Fàbregas scored the winning penalty of the shootout as Spain prevailed 4–2. In the final against Italy, Fàbregas started and provided the assist to [[David Silva]] for the game's opening goal, en route to a 4–0 Spain victory.

Fàbregas was named in the provisional squad in the lead up to the [[2013 Confederations Cup]] by del Bosque.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.futaa.com/football/article/confed-cup-spain-name-provisional-squad-for-nigeria-others|title=Confed Cup:Spain name provisional squad for Nigeria, others|date=27 May 2013|work=futaa.com|accessdate=16 July 2013 }}</ref> He made two starts in the competition and one substitute appearance, all during the group stage of the competition, and assisting a goal in Spain's opening group match against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], which Spain won 2-1.<ref>{{cite web|title=2013 FIFA Confederations Cup - Group B - Spain vs. Uruguay: 2-1|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/match/97895/spain-vs-uruguay/report?|accessdate=16 July 2013}}</ref> Spain won all their group matches, only conceding a goal and scoring 15. Spain advanced to the final of the competition for the first time, after a lengthy and difficult semi-final clash in a re-match against their opponents of the [[Euro 2012 final|European Championship Final]] of the previous year, [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. The match ended 0–0 after extra time and Spain won 7–6 in the resulting penalty shoot-out, but were eventually defeated 3–0 in the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup Final|final]] by hosts and defending champions [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]].

==== 2014 World Cup ====

Fàbregas was named in Spain's 30-man provisional squad for the World Cup,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27394287|title=World Cup 2014: Diego Costa and Fernando Torres in Spain squad|work=BBC Sport|date=13 May 2014|accessdate=5 July 2014}}</ref> and was also included in the final list for the tournament.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27647635|title=World Cup 2014: Spain drop Alvaro Negredo and Jesus Navas|work=BBC Sport|date=31 May 2014|accessdate=5 July 2014}}</ref> He made his debut in the tournament in the opening 1–5 defeat to the Netherlands, replacing [[David Silva]] for the last 12 minutes.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25285043|title=Spain 1–5 Netherlands|publisher=BBC Sport|date=13 June 2014|accessdate=5 July 2014}}</ref> With Spain already eliminated, he played 22 minutes of 3–0 win against [[Australia national association football team|Australia]] in the last group game, this time in place of [[Santi Cazorla]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25285263|title=Australia 0–3 Spain|publisher=BBC Sport|last1=Chowdhury|first1=Saj|date=23 June 2014|accessdate=5 July 2014}}</ref>

== Style of play ==

=== Arsenal and Chelsea ===

[[File:Cesc Fabregas v LCFC 2014 02.jpg|thumb|260px|upright|Fàbregas playing for Chelsea in 2014]]
Originally brought to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] as a youth to slowly develop via the League Cup, Fàbregas was unexpectedly deployed as Arsenal's starting [[Centre midfield|central midfielder]] following injuries to fellow midfielders [[Patrick Vieira]], [[Gilberto Silva]] and [[Eduardo César Gaspar|Edu]] during the 2004–05 season. While [[defensive midfielder]] Vieira served as his role model and mentor,<ref>Townsend, Nick, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20051002/ai_n15644739 "Spanish marvel blossoms"], ''The Independent'', 2 October 2005, accessed 17 September 2007. {{Wayback|df=yes|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20051002/ai_n15644739|date =20080314115614|bot=DASHBot}}</ref> he styled his game after his childhood hero and compatriot [[Josep Guardiola]]; whose shirt number 4 he would inherit in his subsequent move to Barcelona in 2011.<ref name=times/> Because he was of a different mould from his Arsenal predecessors who played in the same position,<ref name=times/><ref name=hubb/> this led to criticisms of his lightweight frame and less aggressive style of play, due to his development in the [[La Masia|Barcelona Youth Academy]],<ref name=hubb/><ref name=harr/> with former teammate [[Ashley Cole]] criticising the Spaniard as "an unproven featherweight" in his autobiography.<ref>Macintosh, Iain, "Completely Fab", ''The New Paper'', 29 September 2007.</ref>

However, it did not take long for Fàbregas to become one of the most coveted and celebrated young talents in the game with his success at Arsenal. Functioning mostly as a [[playmaker]] and renowned for his passing range, he was described as the general of Arsenal's first team, bringing vision, creativity, and an innate understanding of timing and space to Arsenal's intricate passing game, displaying maturity that belied his age.<ref name=espn/><ref name=ars/><ref name=uefap/><ref name=fa/><ref name=pots/><ref name=chall/><ref name=skates>Smith, Alan, [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2007/01/20/sfnsmi20.xml "Fabregas puts his skates on in chase for perfection"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 20 January 2007, accessed 23 May 2007.</ref><ref>McIlvanney, Hugh, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2094-2104071,00.html "Fàbregas a leader in waiting"], ''The Times'', 26 March 2006, accessed 22 May 2007.</ref> He was the main creative force when he was at Arsenal, as exemplified by his 16 assists in all competitions in the 2006–07 season.<ref name=stats/> Between 2006–07 and 2010–11, Fàbregas created the most chances in the top-division leagues of England, Spain, Italy, Germany and France.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14491850.stm The magic of Cesc Fabregas], BBC Sport, 11 August 2011, accessed 15 August 2011.</ref>

At Arsenal, Fàbregas also often assumed responsibility for [[Set piece (football)|set pieces]], taking [[corner kick|corners]], [[Direct free kick|free kicks]] and [[Penalty kick|penalties]]. By his own admission, scoring was a weaker part of his game in his first few seasons at Arsenal; wasteful finishing also being symptomatic of the larger problem surrounding Arsenal in the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons.<ref name=skates/> This changed initially in the 2007–08 season when he scored 11 goals in his first 16 games, and Arsenal manager Wenger claimed that the Spaniard's previous inability to score was down to a mental state, and even compared the Spaniard to [[Michel Platini]], a French midfielder renowned for scoring.<ref>[http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/wenger-fabregas-has-the-vision-of-platini Wenger: Fabregas has the vision of Platini], Arsenal F.C., 19 September 2007, accessed 4 January 2008.</ref><ref>[http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/wenger-this-team-is-blossoming-and-growing- Wenger: 'This team is blossoming and growing'], Arsenal F.C., 15 September 2007, accessed 17 September 2007.</ref> There were also concerns raised over the large number of games Fàbregas was playing for club and country at such a young age,<ref name=Spain/><ref>van Wijk, Jim, [http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/premiership/article2401632.ece "Fabregas in need of rest after season of hard work"], ''The Independent'', 29 March 2007, accessed 24 May 2007.</ref> but while he initially avoided long spells on the sidelines, he played significantly fewer games due to injury in his last three seasons with Arsenal.

At Chelsea, Fàbregas played a similar [[Playmaker|playmaking]] role in midfield, using his technique, ball control, vision, and passing ability to dictate the tempo of his team's play, while he was supported by defensive midfielders, in order to give him more space and time on the ball.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cesc Fabregas happy pulling the strings from Chelsea's midfield|url=http://www.espnfc.com/chelsea/story/2200896/chelseas-cesc-fabregas-believes-his-good-form-in-the-premier-league-is-due-to-his-deployment-his-favoured-central-midfield-role|accessdate=27 January 2015}}</ref> In this deeper creative role,<ref>{{cite web|title=Cesc Fabregas Says He is Thriving in Deeper Chelsea Role|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/cesc-fabregas-says-he-thriving-deeper-chelsea-role-1470915|accessdate=27 January 2015}}</ref> he excelled in Chelsea's new style of play under Mourinho,<ref>{{cite web|title=Cesc Fabregas believes Chelsea success down to Jose Mourinho playing him in the right position|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/cesc-fabregas-believes-chelsea-success-4816953|accessdate=27 January 2015}}</ref> where he proved to be an effective [[Assist (football)|assist]]-provider.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cesc Fàbregas|url=http://www.espnfc.com/player/38886/cesc-fabregas|accessdate=27 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas: My favourite assists|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/players/cesc-fabregas/11370990/Chelseas-Cesc-Fabregas-My-favourite-assists.html|accessdate=27 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas: I am playing the best football of my life|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/11256429/Chelsea-midfielder-Cesc-Fabregas-I-am-playing-the-best-football-of-my-life.html|accessdate=27 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas: Thierry Henry assist record 'not an obsession'|url=http://www.espnfc.com/barclays-premier-league/story/2267016/chelseas-cesc-fabregas-thierry-henry-assist-record-for-arsenal-not-an-obsession|accessdate=27 January 2015}}</ref>

=== Barcelona and Spain ===

At Barcelona, Fàbregas continued to play a prominent [[midfield]] and [[Playmaker|playmaking]] role, although he was moved into a more offensive position than that which he had occupied at Arsenal. His new role with Barcelona was comparable to that which he had played with the [[Spanish national football team|Spanish national team]]. He effortlessly fit into [[Pep Guardiola]]'s 4-3-3 formation, participating in the midfield's trademark [[Tiki-taka|"tiki-taka"]] patient, attacking, build-up style of play, also associated with the Spanish National Squad under Vincente Del Bosque and [[Luis Aragonés]]. Fàbregas was used in a variety of different roles under Guardiola, scoring several goals and providing many assists. Due to the presence of [[Xavi]], [[Sergio Busquets]] and [[Andrés Iniesta]] in the three man midfield, as well as the emerging [[Thiago Alcântara|Thiago]], however, Fàbregas was often employed out of position as a [[Winger (association football)|winger]], or even as a supporting [[Forward (association football)|forward]] under Guardiola. He regularly performed in the role that [[Lionel Messi]] had often occupied during the previous season, functioning as a [[False nine|false-9]] in a [[Formation (association  football)#4–6–0|4–6–0 formation]] (a role which he would also play for Spain at [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]] under [[Vicente del Bosque]]),<ref>{{cite web|title=False nine Fabregas shows his importance, and more|url=http://chroniclesofalmunia.wordpress.com/2012/06/11/false-nine-fabregas-shows-his-importance-and-more/|accessdate=14 September 2013}}</ref> whilst Messi would play as a right winger or second forward.<ref>{{cite web|title=Guardiola's Barcelona-Reinventing Total Football|url=http://www.thefalse9.com/2012/04/guardiolas-barcelona-reinventing-total.html|accessdate=14 September 2013}}</ref> Fàbregas was, however, still used in deeper roles on occasion, as an attacking, deep-lying or central playmaking midfielder, in particular under Guardiola's successors [[Tito Vilanova]] and [[Tata Martino]].

== Outside football ==

=== Personal life ===

Fàbregas and his partner Daniella Semaan have a daughter named Lia, who was born on 10 April 2013.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://m.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2013/may/11/fame-fortune-sportsman-family-childbirth | title = They have fame and often fortunes but what of a sportsman's family? | publisher = guardian.co.uk | accessdate = 12 May 2013}}</ref>

=== Sponsorship ===

In 2011, Fàbregas signed a sponsorship deal with German sportswear and equipment supplier, [[Puma SE|Puma]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.footballboots.co.uk/3724-official-fabregas-to-wear-puma-boots.html | title = Official: Fabregas to wear Puma boots | publisher = Football Boots | accessdate = 30 September 2011 }}</ref> He appeared in an advert for the new Puma PowerCat 1.12 in September 2011 and was one of the flagship wearers of Puma's PowerCat range of football boots.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.footballboots.co.uk/8107-yellow-custom-powercats-for-fabregas.html | title = Yellow Custom PowerCats For Fabregas| publisher = FootballBoots.co.uk | accessdate = 30 September 2011 }}</ref> When the PowerCat was succeeded by the evoPower, again Fàbregas was the forefront of Puma's marketing campaign. In January 2014, the brand launched a C4 evoPower boot,<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.footballboots.co.uk/22579-c4-fabregas-evopower.html | title = PUMA launch special C4 evoPOWER for Fabregas| publisher = FootballBoots.co.uk | accessdate = 3 January 2014 }}</ref> specifically designed for just Fàbregas to wear.

=== Other projects ===

Fàbregas starred in his own one-time only television programme, called ''"The Cesc Fàbregas Show: Nike Live"'', that aired on 19 May 2008. The programme was sponsored by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and was shown on [[Sky Sports]]. The show featured Fàbregas in several sketches with Arsenal teammates like [[Philippe Senderos]] and [[Nicklas Bendtner]], as well as coach [[Arsène Wenger]], Fàbregas's parents and ''[[Little Britain]]'' star [[Matt Lucas]].<ref>[http://inside.nike.com/blogs/nikefootball-en_SG/tags/nikelive?view=all NIKELIVE], NikeLiveFabregas.com, accessed 19 April 2008.</ref>
