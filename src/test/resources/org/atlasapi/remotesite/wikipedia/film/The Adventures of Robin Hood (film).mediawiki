'''''The Adventures of Robin Hood''''' is a 1938 American [[swashbuckler film]] directed by [[Michael Curtiz]] and [[William Keighley]], and starring [[Errol Flynn]], [[Olivia de Havilland]], [[Basil Rathbone]], and [[Claude Rains]]. Written by [[Norman Reilly Raine]] and [[Seton I. Miller]], the film is about a Saxon lord who, in King Richard's absence, fights back as the outlaw leader of a rebel guerrilla army against Prince John and the Norman Lords who are oppressing the Saxon people. ''The Adventures of Robin Hood'' was filmed in [[Technicolor]].

==Plot==
When [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] ([[Ian Hunter (actor)|Ian Hunter]]), the [[List of English monarchs|King of England]], is taken captive by [[Leopold V, Duke of Austria|Leopold of Austria]] while returning from the [[Third Crusade|Crusades]], his brother [[John of England|John]] ([[Claude Rains]]) takes power and proceeds to oppress the [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] commoners. Prince John raises their taxes, supposedly to raise Richard's ransom, but in reality to secure his own position on the throne.

One man stands in his way, the Saxon [[Robin Hood|Robin, Earl of Locksley]] ([[Errol Flynn]]). Robin acquires a loyal follower when he saves [[Much the Miller's Son|Much]] ([[Herbert Mundin]]) from being arrested by  Sir [[Guy of Gisbourne]] ([[Basil Rathbone]]) for [[poaching]] one of the king's deer. Robin goes alone to see Prince John at Gisbourne's castle and announces to John's assembled supporters and a contemptuous [[Maid Marian]] ([[Olivia DeHavilland]]) that he will do all in his power to oppose John and restore Richard to his rightful place. He then escapes, in spite of the efforts of John's men.

His lands and title now forfeit, Robin takes refuge in [[Sherwood Forest]] with his friend [[Will Scarlet]] ([[Patric Knowles]]). There they meet [[Little John]] ([[Alan Hale, Sr.]]), whom Robin recruits after a bruising [[quarterstaff]] bout. Other men join their growing band. Later, Robin provokes [[Friar Tuck]] ([[Eugene Pallette]]) into a swordfight, but then persuades the friar into joining him to provide spiritual guidance to the outlaws. Soon, Prince John and his Norman and Angevin cronies find themselves harassed beyond all bearing with many of their troops receiving instant deadly retribution for their abuses courtesy of the Merry Men's arrows.

One day, Robin and his men capture a large party of [[Normans]] transporting taxes through Sherwood. Among Robin's "guests" are Gisbourne, the cowardly [[Sheriff of Nottingham]] ([[Melville Cooper]]), and Maid Marian. Robin and his men "liberate" the tax money, swearing to a man to contribute it towards King Richard's ransom. At first, Marian is disdainful of Robin and his "band of cut-throats", but becomes convinced of his good intentions and begins to see the reality of things. Eventually Robin lets the humiliated Gisbourne and sheriff go, telling them that they have Marian to thank for their lives.

The Sheriff then comes up with a cunning scheme to capture Robin. He suggests to Prince John that he announce an archery tournament, with the grand prize a golden arrow to be presented by Maid Marian, knowing that Robin will be unable to resist the challenge. All goes as planned; Robin identifies himself by winning the competition and is taken prisoner. Gisbourne sentences him to be hanged.  However, Marian warns Robin's men, and they manage to rescue him on his way to the gallows. Later, in the dark of night, Robin sneaks into the castle to thank her. Marian and Robin declare their love for each other.

Meanwhile, King Richard returns to England disguised as a monk, but is recognized at an inn by the Bishop of the Black Canons ([[Montagu Love|Montague Love]]) after he overhears one of Richard's men call him "sire".  The traitorous bishop hurries to inform Prince John. Upon receiving the news, John and Gisbourne plot to dispose of Richard quietly before he can raise an army. Dickon Malbete ([[Harry Cording]]), a disgraced former knight, is sent to assassinate him in return for the restoration of his rank and Robin's estate. Marian overhears them and writes a note warning Robin, but Gisbourne finds it and has her arrested and condemned to death for treason. Marian's nurse Bess ([[Una O'Connor (actress)|Una O'Connor]]) informs her boyfriend Much, who intercepts and kills Dickon after a desperate struggle. 

Richard and his escort travel to Sherwood Forest to find Robin. When Richard is certain of Robin's loyalty, he reveals his identity. Then they learn from Much that John intends to have himself crowned king by the Bishop of the Black Canons in Nottingham the next day. 

Knowing that the castle is too strong to take by force, Robin decides to use guile, visiting the bishop and "persuading" him to include Robin and his men, in disguise, in his entourage. Through this ruse, they gain entry to the castle and interrupt John's coronation. A melee breaks out, during which Robin and Gisbourne engage in a prolonged swordfight. Gisbourne is finally slain, and Robin rescues Marian from her cell.

Richard is restored to the throne; he exiles his brother, pardons the outlaws, returns Robin's earldom and 'orders' him to marry Maid Marian. Robin exclaims, "May I obey all your commands with equal pleasure, sire!"

==Production==
''The Adventures of Robin Hood'' was filmed on location in various areas of [[California]] and in Union, Washington, on the Olympic Peninsula.  Several of the original cottages are still in use.

[[Bidwell Park]] in [[Chico, California|Chico]] stood in for [[Sherwood Forest]],<ref>The Worldwide Guide to Movie Locations by Tony Reeves. The Titan Publishing Group. Pg.14 [http://www.movie-locations.com/films.html]</ref> although one major scene was filmed at the California locations "Lake Sherwood" and "Sherwood Forest", so named because they were the location sites for the 1922 [[Douglas Fairbanks]] production of ''[[Robin Hood (1922 film)|Robin Hood]]''. Several scenes were shot at the Warner Bros. Burbank Studios and the Warner Ranch in [[Calabasas]]. The archery tournament was filmed at [[Busch Gardens]] in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]].

[[James Cagney]] was originally cast as Robin Hood, but walked out on his contract with Warner Bros., paving the way for Flynn,<ref name="Ebert" /> although filming was postponed three years.<ref name="films">Tony Thomas, Rudy Behlmer * Clifford McCarty, ''The Films of Errol Flynn'', Citadel Press, 1969 p 62-67</ref>

It was produced at an estimated cost of $2 million, and was Warner Bros first color film utilizing three-strip [[Technicolor]] process.<ref name="Ebert">{{cite news| first=Roger| last=Ebert|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20030817/REVIEWS08/308170301/1023| title=Roger Ebert's review of "The Adventures of Robin Hood"| publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=August 17, 2003| accessdate=March 30, 2007}} The first, preceding it by a few months, was ''[[Gold is Where You Find It]]'', which tested the process as a run-up to ''The Adventures of Robin Hood''.</ref>  It was an unusually extravagant production for the [[Warner Bros.]] studio, which had made a name for itself in producing socially conscious low-budget [[gangster film]]s,<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/books/08/24/mob.movies/index.html |title = The mobster and the movies |accessdate = July 9, 2008 | date=August 24, 2004 | work=CNN}}</ref> but their adventure movies starring Flynn had generated hefty revenue and ''Robin Hood'' was created to capitalize on this.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} 

Padded [[stunt man|stunt men]] and bit players were paid $150 per arrow for being shot by professional archer Howard Hill, who was cast as Owen the Welshman, an archer defeated in the tournament by Robin. To win, Robin splits the arrow of Philip of Arras, a captain of the guard under Gisbourne, who had struck the bullseye. An examination of the film images in slow motion led to speculation{{who|date=December 2012}} that the arrow split may have been made of [[bamboo]], and have been previously split, the parts being held together with small rings. Buster Wiles - a stuntman and close friend of Errol Flynn - maintains that the arrow splitting stunt was carried out using an extra large arrow (for the target) and that the second arrow had a wide, flat arrowhead and was fired along a wire. Wiles discusses the scene in his autobiography, ''[[My Days With Errol Flynn]]''.

==Reception==
The film was well-reviewed and became the second highest-grossing film of [[1938 in film|the year]], with just over $4 million in revenues,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} at a time when the average ticket price was less than 25 cents.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/2009/02/06/2009-02-06_the_depressionera_gems_at_1930s_prices.html |title =  The Depression-era gems at 1930s prices |accessdate = October 5, 2010 | date=February 6, 2009 | work=NY Daily News | location=New York | first=Elizabeth | last=Weitzman}}</ref> Warner Bros. was so pleased with the results that they cast Flynn in two more color epics before the decade was over{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}: ''[[Dodge City (1939 film)|Dodge City]]'' and ''[[The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex]]''.

A sequel, ''Robin of Locksley'' was announced but never developed.<ref name="films"/>

==Legacy==
Due to the movie's popularity, Errol Flynn's name and image became inextricably linked with that of Robin Hood in the public eye, even more so than [[Douglas Fairbanks]], who had played the role previously in 1922.<ref>{{cite news|title= Classic Hollywood: 100 years of Robin Hood movies|work= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=May 12, 2010|url= http://articles.latimes.com/2010/may/12/entertainment/la-et-classic-hollywood-20100512|accessdate=October 2, 2010|first=Susan|last=King}}</ref>

This was the third film to pair Flynn and Olivia de Havilland (after ''[[Captain Blood (1935 film)|Captain Blood]]'' and ''[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936 film)|The Charge of the Light Brigade]]'').  They would ultimately star together in eight films.

Scenes and costumes worn by the characters have been imitated and spoofed endlessly.  For instance, in the [[Bugs Bunny]] animated [[short film]], ''[[Rabbit Hood]]'', Bugs is continually told by a dim-witted Little John that "Robin Hood will soon be here." When Bugs finally meets Robin at the end of the film, he is stunned to find that it is Errol Flynn, in a spliced-in clip from this film (he subsequently shakes his head and declares, "It couldn't be him!"). Other parodies were [[Daffy Duck]] and [[Porky Pig]] in ''[[Robin Hood Daffy]]'' and [[Goofy]] and [[Pete (Disney)|Black Pete]] in [[Goof Troop]]'s ''Goofin' Hood & His Melancholy Men''.

A fragment of one of the film's sword fighting scenes was converted to [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] by [[Jordan Mechner]] and used for his 1989 [[platform game]] ''[[Prince of Persia (1989 video game)|Prince of Persia]]''.<ref name="GDC2011">{{cite speech|title=Classic Game Postmortem: PRINCE OF PERSIA|first=Jordan|last=Mechner|authorlink=Jordan Mechner|event=Game Developers Conference|location=San Francisco, California|date=2011|url=http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1014634/Classic-Game-Postmortem-PRINCE-OF|accessdate=30 May 2013|time=38:35}}</ref>
