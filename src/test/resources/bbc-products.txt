Armstrong & Miller: The Complete Radio Series
<p>The complete BBC Radio 4 comedy sketch series from Alexander Armstrong and Ben Miller. </p><p>Welcome to the strange world of Armstrong & Miller, which includes some comedy sketches with tough-guy cops in Parsons and Lampkin (and Lampkin's Mate Steve), and there's an insider's view of National Trousers Day - 'because involvement should be as easy as a walk to the wardrobe'. </p><p>More highlights include some really macho rock climbers, and the corrupt world of mountaineering: is Everest the tallest mountain, or are there others they keep quiet about so they don't have to climb them? </p><p>There's a track from rock legends Strijka, and you can also hear how Logarythm - the world's most successful school band - got together. </p><p>Aided and abetted by Samuel West and Tony Gardner, this is the complete radio series, which contains all four episodesIterator. </p>
