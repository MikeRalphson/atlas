<![CDATA[<p>
THEY love 4x4s Down Under so Oz was perfect for testing the new Range Rover 
Sport. 
</p>
<p>
The Blue Mountains and the Bathurst Racing Circuit were the venues and 
everyone was impressed, including rugby&#8217;s Lawrence Dallaglio &#8211; a Land Rover 
Global Ambassador &#8211; and our Aborigine guide Gumba Wakka Wakka. 
</p>
<p>
THE original Range Rover Sport was a success, despite being flawed. 
</p>
<p>
Nearly 400,000 have been sold worldwide since 2006. So imagine how many will 
sell when buyers find out how much better the all-new version is. 
</p>
<p>
<i>The new Sport lives up to its name &#8212; Range Rover&#8217;s upstart little brother 
has come of age, big time. </i>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
It is a big SUV capable of outrageous things off-road and storming around a 
race circuit like a sportscar. Its talents have stretched in every 
direction, from head-turning design and limousine luxury to its ability to 
now carry up to seven people in style. And as the starting price is nearly 
&#163;20,000 cheaper than the non-sport Range Rover, it does beg a question. 
</p>
<p>
Who needs its big brother? 
</p>
<p>
The reality is the more stately version will still appeal to those customers 
drawn by the fact it is 4x4 royalty. But I can see BMW, Audi, Mercedes and 
Porsche SUV drivers switching to the more souped-up and sophisticated Sport. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Design boss Gerry McGovern and his team have done brilliantly, transforming 
the boxy old model into a much sleeker, more powerful style. 
</p>
<p>
It has shed 420kg with its lightweight aluminium body, so it is now as nimble 
as the British &amp; Irish Lions&#8217; George North at full pelt. 
</p>
<p>
But it is still two tons of motor &#8212; easy to forget as it handles so well and 
takes corners at unbelievable speeds with more accurate steering. It 
certainly took the Bathurst circuit in its stride. Just how fast you go 
depends on the engine you choose. The three-litre turbo diesel will surely 
be the choice of Brits because of nearly 38mpg and its useful turn of speed 
&#8212; 0-60mph in 7.1secs. It tops out at 130mph. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
A three-litre V6 petrol cuts 0-60mph time to 6.9secs but fuel economy drops to 
26mpg. The monster five-litre V8 reduces 0-60mph to a sportscar-like five 
seconds and a top speed of 150mph. 
</p>
<p>
&#8216;Wade rivers and power through mud&#8217; Only a fuel economy figure of 22mpg &#8212; less 
than twenty if you really hammer the engine &#8212; dampens the V8&#8217;s appeal. 
</p>
<p>
Improvements include more room for rear passengers because, despite its weight 
loss, it&#8217;s a couple of inches longer. Rear passengers also get reclining 
seats and there is more boot space at 784litres. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
For the first time there is the option of seven seats. Everything on board has 
been upgraded in comfort and quality levels &#8212; from business class to 
first-class. The cabin now matches the classic Range Rover but has a sloping 
centre console and a sporty gear lever instead of the rotary dial gear knob. 
</p>
<p>
You get executive toys and luxury close to a Bentley, plus Land Rover&#8217;s All 
Terrain mode that lets you climb mountains, wade rivers and power through 
mud and snow at the click of a dial. 
</p>
<p>
But if you fail to recognise serious changes in condition the Range Sport will 
adapt the suspension and traction by itself. How smart is that? 
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s aimed at active types and has options such as a cycle rack. 
</p>
<p>
Just don&#8217;t be like me and go for a mountain bike ride with Lawrence Dallaglio 
&#8212; he&#8217;s mad. 
</p>
<p>
<i>But the former Lions great has the perfect credentials to judge the new 
Range Rover Sport.</i> 
</p>
<p>
A Range Rover Vogue owner for the past ten years, Lawrence had never 
considered a Sport before. But after two days with me putting it through its 
paces in the city, across country and in the Australian wilderness he&#8217;d 
changed his mind and ordered a Sport. 
</p>
<p>
He said: &#8220;I think it&#8217;s an absolutely awesome car. I&#8217;ve been blown away by how 
agile it is. It&#8217;s like a top sportsman with every attribute. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;They have taken all the very best of the Range Rover models and put it into 
this car &#8212; but added to it. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;From driving in the city, the Australian bush and even a race circuit, it has 
done the business wherever we have taken it.&#8221;
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
For me the new Sport is the complete all-rounder with a real touch of class, 
with prices that range from &#163;51,000 to more than &#163;80,000 for the elite 
version. 
</p>
<p>
When I crossed the line at Bathurst I was in no doubt that Range Rover have a 
major new hit on their hands. 
</p>
<p>
Land Rover have taken all the best of the Range Rover and Sport but added an 
extra dimension. It has really impressed me with how capable it is, 
especially its road handling and comfort. It is the ultimate allrounder. 
</p>
<p>
<i>And, just like the Lions, it has taken everything Australia could throw at 
it.</i>

<tol-text:story>
<![CDATA[<p>
PICASSO had an eye for beauty so we think he would have approved of the new 
Citroen model that bears his name. 
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s hard not to look at the C4 Picasso with these two stunning models in 
front of it &#8211; sadly they are not an option with the car. 
</p>
<p>
But after a test drive to the beach, the girls confirmed that the new Picasso 
achieves its main role of transporting people in comfort and style &#8211; thanks 
in part to its extra leg room. 
</p>
<p>
The Picasso has always stood out from the crowd and the more extrovert styling 
has clearly been a hit with buyers &#8211; Citroen have sold 3million since 1999, 
nearly 400,000 of them in the UK. 
</p>
<p>
In just three years, they have sold 350,000 DS models &#8212; and the figure is 
growing fast. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
A new DS3 cabriolet is on sale for summer and an SUV is on the way. 
</p>
<p>
The only problem with the success of the DS is that Citroen&#8217;s mainstream, more 
functional models have been pushed into the background. 
</p>
<p>
But with those mainstream models still accounting for 80 per cent of their 
annual European sales, Citroen are fully aware of the need to revitalise the 
cars that remain their bread and butter. 
</p>
<p>
Citroen UK boss Linda Jackson told me the success of the DS is allowing the 
firm to cater for two different types of customer and helping to increase 
overall sales by 15 per cent so far this year. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
She said: &#8220;DS models are appealing to buyers who want more style and 
individuality, who like to personalise their cars, whereas our mainstream 
customers want more practicality and value for money. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The success of the DS is great but our mainstream models remain very 
important. They still account for 70 per cent of UK sales and we needed to 
re-invent our line-up, which is what we are now doing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Linda argues that there is no reason why family buyers of mainstream models 
can&#8217;t have a &#8220;stylish&#8221; car as well as a user-friendly family motor. 
</p>
<p>
The big-selling C4 Picasso &#8212; a mainstream model that has always stood out &#8212; is 
the perfect place to start their transformation. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
It will be followed by the seven-seater Grand Picasso at the end of the year. 
After that, the C1 city car will get a facelift next year, followed by the 
C4. 
</p>
<p>
Citroen are still deciding how to replace their flagship C5 &#8212; but it is 
unlikely to be another &#8220;me too&#8221; big family car. 
</p>
<p>
The firm are also desperate to get a small compact SUV &#8212; like the Peugeot 2008 
and the Renault Captur &#8212; on to the market. 
</p>
<p>
They are also considering a replacement for the C2 small car. 
</p>
<p>
This week we tested the new C4 Picasso to see if it hits the sweet spot. 
</p>
<h4>
ROAD TEST: CITROEN C4 PICASSO 
</h4>
<p>
</p>
<p>
NAMING a car Picasso has proved a masterstroke by Citroen. 
</p>
<p>
It may not be a masterpiece but three million sales have made the Picasso a 
financial success story and a class leader in the people carrier market. 
</p>
<p>
And the UK has been a big part of the Picasso success, with more than 400,000 
sales here since 1999. 
</p>
<p>
Now Citroen think they have come up with an all-new version that will become 
another collector&#8217;s item for family motorists. 
</p>
<p>
Picasso was known for his provocative paintings and Citroen&#8217;s motoring version 
has always brought an injection of much-needed character and controversy to 
the bland world of people carriers. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
The new version continues that trend with a bold, expressive face that sees 
the trademark double chevron blades stretched into new LED headlights, with 
daytime running lights above them like eyebrows, and a double grille below. 
</p>
<p>
The side profile is sleeker and more dynamic as the Picasso is 4cm shorter 
than the current model and sits 1.61cm lower. 
</p>
<p>
Rear LED lights with a 3D effect complete a more dramatic all-round look. 
</p>
<p>
But people carriers remain all about interior space and practicality, which is 
why we got four stunning models on board to underline that despite being 4cm 
shorter there is actually 2cm MORE legroom. 
</p>
<p>
The models were impressed with the space and they liked the Picasso&#8217;s funky 
interior. 
</p>
<p>
But obviously children will fit even better into the three rear seats &#8211; and 
they will appreciate things like the full-length panoramic roof. 
</p>
<p>
There is 5.3m of glass in the Picasso, which makes it feel as if you are 
sitting in a giant goldfish bowl. 
</p>
<p>
Passengers are nicely pampered with options such as massaging seats, 
soft-relax headrests and a front passenger seat with an aircraft-style leg 
support. 
</p>
<p>
Doddle Kids and adults will enjoy the connectivity package that has apps to 
link you with everything from your phone, music choices to Twitter and the 
internet. 
</p>
<p>
But the two large digital screens &#8211; 7in and 12in &#8211; on the dash seem a bit like 
overkill, as well as being a distraction for the driver at times. 
</p>
<p>
The driver will like the option of a 360&#176; vision camera and a park-assist 
system that means all he or she has to do is follow the instructions to 
accelerate or brake. It makes parking a doddle. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Boot space has increased from 537 litres to 630 with the rear seats up. Fold 
them down and the space hits a van-like 1,700-plus litres. 
</p>
<p>
The front passenger seats also fold to cater for awkward loads up to 2.5m, so 
the Picasso is definitely family-friendly. 
</p>
<p>
It is also bank account-friendly when it comes to fuel, thanks to a range of 
new, more efficient diesel and petrol engines. They are led by a 1.6litre 
diesel with a clutchless gearbox that returns 74mpg and road tax-free 98g/m 
CO2. 
</p>
<p>
All the 1.6litre and 2litre diesel engines offer a good combination of 
refinement, performance and around 60mpg, while the 1.6litre turbo petrol is 
quick and you still get between 45 and 55mpg. 
</p>
<p>
The new C4 Picasso handles and drives considerably better than the current 
model. It feels more agile thanks to its lower and more compact size, along 
with revised suspension and the fact it is 140kg lighter. 
</p>
<p>
So Citroen have delivered a mainstream model with a touch of individuality 
that will appeal to style-conscious family car buyers. 
</p>
<p>
And with prices ranging from &#163;17,500 to &#163;24,500, it&#8217;s highly competitive with 
the current model. 
</p>
<p>
But it is a much better car, making it the value for money that Citroen buyers 
expect.

<![CDATA[<p>
LEXUS are trying hard to grab your attention. 
</p>
<p>
Not only are their models getting a radical restyling, their advertising goes 
under the full-on banner Amazing Emotion. 
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s quite a turnaround for a car firm previously not very big at all on 
emotion &#8212; Lexus used to be all about superior quality and customer service. 
</p>
<p>
They were a safe, if uninspiring, premium brand that appealed to buyers 
wanting something different without rocking the boat. 
</p>
<p>
It got Lexus established and has seen them clock up 5.6million sales since 
they were set up in 1989 as the luxury arm of Toyota. 
</p>
<p>
Aggressive American buyers fell in love with Lexus but the rest of the world 
has proved tougher to crack. 
</p>
<p>
Lexus sold 45,610 cars in Europe last year &#8212; fewer than the number of 3 Series 
cars BMW shifted in the UK. 
</p>
<p>
In fact, Lexus&#8217;s progress has slowed in recent years, largely because of the 
economic state of Europe. 
</p>
<p>
So they are now looking at reinventing themselves with a much more aggressive, 
style-led range. 
</p>
<p>
They also plan to extend their line-up in the next two years, with a compact 
SUV and a new coupe/cabriolet version of their IS junior executive car. 
</p>
<p>
Here I report on my test-drive of the IS &#8212; Lexus&#8217;s key model for kick-starting 
sales, particularly across Europe. 
</p>
<h4>
ROAD TEST: LEXUS IS 300hF SPORT 
</h4>
<p>
THE original IS summed up the Lexus brand &#8211; a premium alternative to the 
Germans but not quite good enough to beat them. 
</p>
<p>
The all-new version is a far more radical affair, especially the F-Sport 
hybrid I tested. 
</p>
<p>
It gets an in-your-face design that features a gaping double grille flanked by 
sparkling headlights and LED running lights. 
</p>
<p>
The side profile gets sharp crease lines in the doors and rear wing, while a 
ballsy back view dominated by long, slashing, diamond rear lights fills the 
IS with visual interest. 
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s a much more imposing look, which now makes the BMW 3 Series, Audi A4 and 
Mercedes C Class look safe and predictable &#8211; like Lexus used to be. The much 
racier feel is carried over into the interior, which takes design cues from 
Lexus&#8217;s LFA supercar. 
</p>
<p>
The cabin has a cockpit flavour, with the easy-to-handle instruments wrapped 
around the driver, who is separated from his passenger by a thick centre 
console. 
</p>
<p>
The interior&#8217;s fit and finish is all top quality, from the lavish leather 
seats to the stylish door trim. 
</p>
<p>
The driving seat position completes the much sportier package as you sit lower 
and cocooned, while the rear passengers are treated to an extra 85mm of leg 
room. Head room is tight for tall adults though. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Lexus are putting their faith in hybrid/petrol engines and offer no diesel 
option, which will be seen by many as a weakness. 
</p>
<p>
But in many ways the 2.5litre petrol/hybrid is a cracker. It&#8217;s stunningly 
refined, quiet as a Rolls-Royce whisper. But it sure packs a punch, with 
178bhp from the petrol engine and a further 141bhp kicking in from the 
electric motor. 
</p>
<p>
You get zero emission in pure electric mode and still just 109g/km of carbon 
emissions &#8211; great for company buyers, as is the economy rating of between 
50mpg and 60mpg. 
</p>
<p>
The only problem is the E-CVT gearbox, which is unresponsive and seems to be 
constantly hunting for gears when you drive it hard. It needs a full auto or 
good manual design, because even using the F1-style paddles fails to improve 
matters. 
</p>
<p>
Yet the IS&#8217;s crisp steering is better than an Audi A4, a match for the Merc 
C-Class and only just pipped by a BMW 3 Series. 
</p>
<p>
In SE trim, the IS300h is only marginally more expensive than a mid-spec 
2litre diesel from Lexus&#8217;s German rivals, but the 300hF Sport pushes the 
price to &#163;33,495. 
</p>
<p>
The IS 300hF Sport is a real alternative to the Germans &#8211; but is likely to 
remain a niche car until Lexus improve the gearbox in the hybrid, or offer a 
good diesel.

<![CDATA[<p>
YOU don&#8217;t think of England footballers driving a Vauxhall Astra &#8211; they&#8217;re more 
likely to be found in a supercar or Range Rover. 
</p>
<p>
Which begs the question: What do Vauxhall get for their four-year deal in 
excess of &#163;20million to sponsor the England team? 
</p>
<p>
And how big a disaster would it be for them if England don&#8217;t make it to next 
year&#8217;s World Cup finals in Brazil? Losers don&#8217;t sell cars. 
</p>
<p>
Vauxhall&#8217;s managing director Duncan Aldred is praying as much as team boss Roy 
Hodgson and thousands of fans that the national side reach the finals. 
</p>
<p>
Aldred is an England fan &#8212; but first and foremost a hard-nosed businessman who 
knows he needs a serious return on his major investment in the side. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
He says the deal is a long-term investment and not dependant on the Three 
Lions getting to Brazil. 
</p>
<p>
But he admits: &#8220;I am desperate the team make it to the World Cup finals.The 
exposure and value of being in a major tournament is a lot higher, the 
awareness is dramatically higher.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
He says: &#8220;Our research shows that car buyers&#8217; awareness of Vauxhall has 
increased by ten per cent and they are more likely to buy a Vauxhall because 
of the sponsorship, which is massive. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And it shows us the sponsorship works and does help to sell cars &#8212; it has 
lifted the brand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
I sat with him watching England in their friendly match against Brazil in the 
Maracana Stadium. He smiled as the Vauxhall name flashed up on billboards in 
front of 80,000 fans and a television audience of millions. 
</p>
<p>
Aldred was equally happy spending the evening with supporters at a Fans&#8217; Zone 
in Rio de Janeiro. 
</p>
<p>
Sponsored by Vauxhall, fans had the chance to meet Sir Trevor Brooking and 
other ex-players such as Danny Mills. 
</p>
<p>
This is part of Vauxhall and the FA&#8217;s plans to give England supporters a 
better deal when they watch the team at Wembley and in far-flung places. 
</p>
<p>
Matches are the high-profile spotlight that mega-bucks sponsorship can shine 
on your brand. 
</p>
<p>
And it goes further than the name on billboards, kit and about 200 cars and 
vans being driven by FA staff. 
</p>
<p>
The sponsorship is being invested by the FA into improving facilities and 
coaching at a national and grassroots level around the country. 
</p>
<p>
Aldred says the sponsorship is a key component in showing the scale of 
ambition Vauxhall have to become the UK&#8217;s top-selling car brand &#8212; and 
preferred choice of the British mainstream car-buying public. 
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s also a great showcase for their most dramatic line-up of new cars in 
their 113-year history. 
</p>
<p>
Aldred says that although there is good awareness of Vauxhall in the UK, many 
potential buyers don&#8217;t realise the major changes made in recent years. 
</p>
<p>
And he believes sponsoring England gives Vauxhall a real connection with the 
British public. 
</p>
<p>
He says: &#8220;We wanted to display our British identity and 113-year heritage of 
making cars in the UK. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;We want to connect with the British public and what better way than 
sponsoring the country&#8217;s football teams? 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;We want to stretch the appeal of the brand and make it aspirational, but 
still affordable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s not only the senior England squad that Vauxhall sponsor. They support all 
age groups as well as the women&#8217;s teams and the England Disabled Team. 
</p>
<p>
But Aldred is aware that just as a good performance in Brazil would bring a 
feelgood factor, failure to qualify or a poor showing would mean Vauxhall 
being associated with an England flop. 
</p>
<p>
He believes the deal is a great shop window for their new models such as the 
Adam city car, Mokka SUV and Cascada convertible, as well as household names 
like the Astra and Corsa. 
</p>
<p>
He says the sponsorship also gives Vauxhall a link to thousands of young fans 
&#8212; car buyers of the future. 
</p>
<p>
Part of the package gives Vauxhall access to England&#8217;s top players and Wayne 
Rooney, <i>above</i>, is designing his own version of the Adam city car. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
It&#8217;s a clever move that helps illustrate the huge potential to personalise a 
car that is Vauxhall&#8217;s answer to the Mini. 
</p>
<p>
Players also meet Vauxhall dealers, owners and the firm&#8217;s workforce, as well 
as taking coaching sessions. 
</p>
<p>
I saw England coach and former player Gary Neville hold a session at the FA&#8217;s 
training HQ at St George&#8217;s Park near Burton, Staffs. 
</p>
<p>
He met a squad of Under 14 players from Doncaster who are sponsored by a local 
Vauxhall dealer. 
</p>
<p>
Neville says: &#8220;Football at grassroots level is crucially important to 
producing the England players of the future, and these events give us a 
chance to meet and encourage young players.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Although Neville says he is not a big car fan, he is impressed with his 
electric/hybrid Vauxhall Ampera that runs on electric and a petrol motor. 
</p>
<p>
He says: &#8220;I&#8217;ve had the car a year and only filled it up five times, because 
most of my trips I can run on pure electric. I also like the silence of the 
car because it&#8217;s a very stress-free place to travel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
England players Glen Johnson and Phil Jagielka are also driving Amperas, while 
Hodgson has an Insignia. 
</p>
<p>
Vauxhall are clearly investing heavily and taking a gamble in their England 
sponsorship deal. 
</p>
<p>
They know that football can be a winning formula &#8212; but that success is not 
guaranteed. 
</p>
<p>
<i>Vauxhall also know that England need to deliver on the pitch if they are to 
reap the rewards in their showrooms. Failure does not bear thinking about.</i>
</p>
<h4 align="center">
&#8216;70mpg and no road tax, a real England favourite&#8217;
</h4>
<h4>
ROAD TEST: VAUXHALL CORSA ECOFLEX 
</h4>
<p>
THE only time an England footballer might have owned a Vauxhall Corsa was as 
their first car as an apprentice. 
</p>
<p>
But I think every England player should be forced to drive a Corsa as a 
reality check to remember what life is like in the real world. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
They would be surprised by how good a modern Corsa is, just as I was when I 
tried the latest model. 
</p>
<p>
Despite being one of the older superminis on the block, the Corsa still looks 
good alongside new rivals and it remains consistently in the top three 
best-selling cars in the UK. 
</p>
<p>
The EcoFlex 1.3 turbo diesel I tested offers a double whammy &#8211; super-clean 
88g/km of CO2 emissions, which means no road tax, plus close to 70mpg with a 
light right foot. 
</p>
<p>
The engine is quiet, refined and reasonably nippy for a supermini, all of 
which mean it is ideal for city commuters. And, unlike superminis of the 
past, it is quite capable of coping with a long motorway drive in a degree 
of comfort. 
</p>
<p>
The Corsa is still the UK&#8217;s third-best selling car, and an all-new version is 
due next year. 
</p>
<p>
Corsa prices start at &#163;9,495 and even this EcoFlex at &#163;15,410 is loose change 
for a footballer. 
</p>
<h4 align="center">
&#8216;As menacing as Rooney with a real turn of pace&#8217;
</h4>
<h4>
ROAD TEST: VAUXHALL VXR8 TOURER 
</h4>
<p>
IF one car in the Vauxhall range might appeal to the extravagant motoring 
tastes of England players it would be the VXR8 Tourer. 
</p>
<p>
In fact, I think it would be the perfect wheels for Wayne Rooney &#8211; lots of 
attitude, in your face, but with the ability to perform. 
</p>
<p>
There is nothing subtle about the VXR8 Tourer estate, hardly surprising when 
you consider it is based on an Australian muscle car. 
</p>
<p>
And it looks as menacing as Rooney after he&#8217;d been subbed by Sir Alex 
Ferguson. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
But when you flatten the accelerator the VXR8 is a real firebrand, with a 
thumping 6.2-litre V8 capable of getting close to supercar speeds. 
</p>
<p>
And the engine sounds like thunder as 0-60mph takes only 4.9 seconds, while 
top speed is limited to 155mph. 
</p>
<p>
Economy is not the VXR Tourer&#8217;s strong point. Drive it to the max and it drops 
to around 17mpg. But you can get close to 30mpg if you treat it gently. 
</p>
<p>
For a big, bulky estate it handles well and can be thrown around with a degree 
of confidence &#8211; although the steering is heavy and the gear changes demand a 
firm hand. On the inside, the cabin feels like an Aussie attempt at luxury. 
</p>
<p>
It has all the bells and whistles of similarly- priced European rivals &#8211; but 
not quite the finish you&#8217;d expect from a &#163;50,000 executive car. 
</p>
<p>
It is, though, seriously comfortable. The sports seats are like two big 
armchairs and it is big on space, with a huge boot that could carry all the 
training gear of the modern footballer. 
</p>
<p>
Like certain footballers, the VXR8 Tourer is full of attitude but likely to be 
an acquired taste. 
</p>
<p>
That means it will also be exclusive &#8211; perfect for an England player.

<tol-text:story>
<![CDATA[<p>
NISSAN have become one of the most inventive and bold mainstream car makers in 
the past few years.
</p>
<p>
The Japanese firm have always been willing to take a risk with models such as 
the original Eighties Micra, the 350Z coup&#233; and the GT-R supercar saloon.
</p>
<p>
But in 2006 they went right out on a limb when the totally different Qashqai 
broke the mould of traditional family hatchbacks.
</p>
<p>
Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn said he was tired of &#8220;me too&#8221; lookalike hatchbacks, 
and that the firm&#8217;s Almera replacement would start a new trend.
</p>
<p>
The Qashqai did just that with its unique styling that was a crossover between 
a hatchback and a compact SUV, aimed at family motorists wanting something 
different.
</p>
<p>
The Qashqai was clearly what motorists had been waiting for. 
</p>
<p>
It was an overnight success and now, six years later, is consistently one of 
Britain and Europe&#8217;s favourite cars and has sold nearly 1.6million models.
</p>
<p>
And when the rest of the car industry follow you, as they did with the 
Qashqai, you know your on to a real winner.
</p>
<p>
In the first four months of 2013 the Qashqai&#8217;s popularity remains as strong as 
ever. It&#8217;s the UK&#8217;s sixth best-selling car and has already clocked up nearly 
20,000 sales.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Nissan quickly realised they had found a new motoring niche with the Qashqai 
and followed it up with the even more radical Juke.
</p>
<p>
The impossible-to-ignore Juke was a pumped-up supermini that looked like a 
cross between a baby SUV and a coup&#233;.
</p>
<p>
It was a model that split opinion and still does &#8212; motorists either love or 
loathe the Juke. 
</p>
<p>
Fortunately for Nissan, it&#8217;s more of love affair and sales are closing in on 
400,000 in less than three years.
</p>
<p>
Now Nissan believe they have found another niche to add to the Juke&#8217;s success 
with a feisty new performance Nismo version and, once again, they appear to 
have scored a bull&#8217;s-eye.
</p>
<p>
They planned to sell just 600 in the UK this year but demand has been so 
strong that number has now been increased to 1,000.
</p>
<p>
Both the Juke and Qashqai are built at Nissan&#8217;s Sunderland factory, which is 
currently looking to produce more than 500,000 vehicles this year, making it 
the most productive car plant in Europe.
</p>
<p>
The factory has also just started production of the Leaf &#8212; the bestselling 
all-electric vehicle in the world. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Nissan have also built a plant at Sunderland to supply batteries for the Leaf, 
creating a further 300 jobs.
</p>
<p>
At the moment, production is just 60 a day, small numbers compared with the 
2,185 Qashqais and Jukes rolling off the lines every day. 
</p>
<p>
But Nissan believe electric motoring and the Leaf will play an increasingly 
important role in the long-term future of motoring.
</p>
<p>
And, this summer, the factory gears up to produce an all-new version of the 
Note &#8212; a small car the Japanese firm expect to appeal to British motorists 
in the same way as the Qashqai and Juke.
</p>
<p>
The last Note was a mini people carrier that was more old-school and although 
it sold reasonably, it failed to capture the imagination.
</p>
<p>
Nissan have rethought the idea and made the new Note a direct rival to the 
Fiesta in the supermini class, sitting above their own entry-level Micra, 
with prices expected to start at about &#163;12,000. 
</p>
<p>
And this time they are giving the Note some style to go with its practicality.
</p>
<p>
They are also promising it will be a technology leader for small cars, with 
all the latest connectivity the modern motorist is looking for.
</p>
<p>
Nissan clearly see the Note regaining them lost sales in the supermini sector, 
with the current Micra losing its sparkle and many of the customers that 
made it such a huge favourite with British buyers in the Eighties and 
Nineties.
</p>
<p>
Nissan built more than 2.3million Micras at Sunderland but that took more than 
18 years.
</p>
<p>
We get a first drive of the Note next month and if they have repeated the 
winning formula of the Qashqai and Juke, they could once again have a 
supermini to rival the success of the original Micra.
</p>
<p></p>
<h4>
ROAD TEST: JUKE NISMO
</h4>
<p>
</p>
<p>
THE Juke has always been the small car that&#8217;s big on attitude.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Now Nissan are giving it performance to match the design attitude by creating 
a Nismo version.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
They see the Nismo range becoming the equivalent of Ford&#8217;s RS and ST, 
Vauxhall&#8217;s VXR and Renault&#8217;s Sport. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
You can tell instantly it is the unruly member of the Juke pack &#8211; with a body 
makeover that gives it an extra edge.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
The in-your-face front end looks more menacing. It has a black/chrome mesh 
grille and a lower grille with red piping and body skirts &#8211; plus LED running 
lights to let everyone know that you&#8217;re in a Nismo.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Add smoked-grey 18in alloy wheels with wider tyres, extra-flared arches, side 
skirts and a rear spoiler and there&#8217;s no way people won&#8217;t see you coming.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
The 1.6litre turbo petrol engine gets an extra 10bhp to give it 187bhp of 
genuine grunt under the bonnet.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
That&#8217;s quick enough to cut 0-62mph to 7.8 seconds, which should be fast enough 
for most Juke drivers.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
And you can still get close to 40mpg driving the Juke around town.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
It&#8217;s not quite serious hot-hatch handling, but it will make you smile.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
On the inside, the Nismo gets a dark and moody treatment.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
But there are flashes of red trim and a red rev counter, drilled metal pedals 
and suede steering wheel that confirm you are driving a special Juke.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Owners will also be able to download a Nismo iPad app, which can store driving 
data and even lap times for the serious go-faster drivers.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Juke prices begin at &#163;14,495 but you pay for the extra Nismo clout.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
They start off at &#163;19,999 &#8211; and rise to &#163;22,195 for the all-wheel-drive auto 
version.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
But with Nissan already sold out and now making extra to meet demand, there 
are clearly plenty of Juke buyers wanting the Nismo experience.
</p>
<p></p>
<h4>
ROAD TEST: QASHQAI 360
</h4>
<p>
</p>
<p>
FAMILY car buyers invariably have to compromise.
</p>
<p>
They want a vehicle to be fashionable and look good &#8211; but what they need is a 
car that is practical to meet the demands of a young family.
</p>
<p>
What Nissan delivered with the original Qashqai was a no-compromise car that 
didn&#8217;t look like a hatchback &#8211; it was more interesting, more roomy &#8211; but 
which cost a similar price. Bingo.
</p>
<p>
It even came with the option of four-wheel drive for families in rural areas 
and provided the option of seven seats in the +2 version.
</p>
<p>
But Nissan have not sat back and basked in the Qashqai&#8217;s big sales.
</p>
<p>
A minor facelift in 2011 smartened up the headlights and grille to give even 
more visual appeal and now they&#8217;ve brought out a 360 version to continue the 
momentum.
</p>
<p>
But the attraction of the Qashqai 360 remains the same basic formula &#8211; big on 
space and practicality, with ultra-economical engines and that high-up 
seating position that mum, dad and the kids like.
</p>
<p>
Qashqais also come equipped with Bluetooth, satnav, air con, glove box cooler 
and 360&#176; monitor that gives you a screen view all around the car &#8211; perfect 
for parking.
</p>
<p>
I tested the 1.6litre diesel &#8211; the best engine &#8211; which delivers a useful mix 
of reasonable performance and the now-vital fuel economy figure of just over 
60mpg. And it&#8217;s tax-friendly at 119g CO2 emissions.
</p>
<p>
There are also 1.5 and 2litre turbo diesels, plus a 1.6litre turbo petrol.
</p>
<p>
The Qashqai&#8217;s handling is very similar to a hatchback, though not quite as 
agile on cornering. But it&#8217;s still a relaxing and comfortable drive.
</p>
<p>
Prices for the Qashqai Visia 1.6 petrol are from &#163;16,595 &#8211; haggle and you&#8217;ll 
get a few hundred off &#8211; with the 360 starting at &#163;19,945 and going up to 
&#163;27,095 for the seven-seat 4x4 +2 model.

<![CDATA[<p>OH, what have they done to the cutest car on the road?</p>
<p>Fiat have taken the supercool 500 and pumped it up into the bloated and ungainly 500L.</p>
<p>They have been unable to resist expanding the 500 range from supermini to a mini people carrier unashamedly to cash in on the car&#8217;s cult status.</p>
<p>Not for the first time, they&#8217;ve followed Mini&#8217;s lead to go XL with their smallest model &#8212; Mini did it with the Countryman &#8212; to squeeze out every possible sale.</p>
<p>But it doesn&#8217;t work because the 500L doesn&#8217;t look like a 500 apart from the headlights and grille, and it certainly doesn&#8217;t drive like one.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing wrong with the 500L as a car and it delivers the space to make it a genuine family-friendly five-seater.</p>
<p>It rides and drives OK but it&#8217;s lost the fun factor of the 500 to become a pretty boring family runabout, although the 0.9litre TwinAir petrol and the 1.3 diesel engines are both useful performers and return over 60mpg.</p>
<p>For me, the awkward styling has lost all of the charm and character of the 500. I think Fiat should have made it a member of their Panda family because it has the quirky style.</p>
<p>The Panda range is all about practicality and that&#8217;s the strong point of the 500L, along with a good quality funky cabin.</p>
<p>The L badge adds another extra to the 500 &#8212; price.</p>
<p>It starts at &#163;14,995 but there are plenty of alternatives at that price &#8212; and more desirable ones still given that the price for the diesel version rises to &#163;16,490.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also just tested the Panda 4x4, confirming my view that the 500L would have made a good addition to its family. The dinky Panda 4x4 has carved out its own niche in the macho world of SUVs since launching in 1983.</p>
<p>But the latest model is facing serious competition from a raft of new baby 4x4 crossovers, such as the Renault Captur, Peugeot 2008 and especially the no-thrills Dacia Duster 4x4 at &#163;10,995. Even the Panda&#8217;s trump card of price is being challenged with the Renault starting at &#163;12,495 and the Peugeot at &#163;12,995, compared with the Fiat&#8217;s starting price of &#163;14,950 for the diesel.</p>
<p>But after a week driving the Panda 4x4, I found it still has plenty going in its favour.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s something about it &#8212; a bit like the animal it&#8217;s named after &#8212; that makes you smile. The latest model is longer, wider and taller, which makes it even more versatile.</p>
<p>It means this Panda is just as happy in the urban jungle as it is off-road, where it performs remarkably well.</p>
<p>There are 15 stowage places around the cabin and boot space is 225litres, going up to 870litres with the rear seats flat. The interior has also benefited from some styling cues inspired by its 500 baby brother, like the colour-coded dashboard and trendy new patterned seats.</p>
<p>The package is completed by the addition of the excellent 0.9litre twin-turbo three cylinder petrol engine that delivers between 50mpg and 60mpg.</p>
<p>So although this new Panda is under threat from some serious rivals, it still has enough attractions to make sure it&#8217;s far from being extinct.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>
YOU must have something special to take on Ferrari. 
</p>
<p>
Going head-to-head with the Italians is motoring&#8217;s Mission: Impossible &#8212; but 
it is a mission Britain&#8217;s McLaren are relishing. 
</p>
<p>
Since branching out from the McLaren Formula One team into road cars in 2010, 
it has been a high-octane performance of non-stop activity. 
</p>
<p>
They have built a state-of-the-art factory and delivered two supercars &#8212; the 
12C Coupe and the 12C Spider, which last year found 1,400 buyers despite 
prices ranging from &#163;176,000 to nearly &#163;250,000. 
</p>
<p>
McLaren&#8217;s decision to go into road cars has been good news for British workers 
too, with more than 1,000 jobs created. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Now McLaren are recruiting a further 100 to work at their Woking factory for 
the next stage of their rapid rise to fully-fledged supercar maker. 
</p>
<p>
The new recruits will be working on the awesome P1 hypercar, due to go on sale 
later this year. 
</p>
<p>
And the P1 will be starting as epic a battle as any on the racetrack between 
McLaren and Ferrari, as it takes on the new hybrid LaFerrari. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
With prices for the McLaren P1 starting at &#163;866,000 and &#163;1million for the 
Ferrari, you can see why the supercar arena has suddenly gone hyper. 
</p>
<p>
Performance from the P1 will be even closer to an F1 car, with the 3.8litre V8 
engine boosted by an electric motor exploding a combined 903bhp &#8212; a crazy 
amount of horses pulling you on. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
It does 0-62mph in less than three seconds, 0-124mph takes less than seven 
seconds and if you have the balls &#8212; and your own racing circuit &#8212; the top 
speed is 217mph. 
</p>
<p>
The carbon fibre P1 has a real drama about it. 
</p>
<p>
Its designer, ex-Ferrari man Frank Stephenson, says: &#8220;It had to look dramatic 
and be beautiful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
And it is, big time. It will also be very exclusive as McLaren are selling 
just 375. 
</p>
<p>
They have already sold two-thirds of those. And with another 500 hot prospects 
being spoken to, it will be sold out very soon. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Only a test drive will reveal who wins the hypercar battle. In truth that is 
irrelevant, as both cars will sell out. 
</p>
<p>
McLaren have announced they are selling 100 50th anniversary editions of the 
12C Coupe and 12C Spider models, with prices from &#163;196,000 to &#163;215,500. 
</p>
<h4>
ROAD TEST: McLAREN SPIDER 
</h4>
<p>
IT&#8217;S amazing what effect going topless can have. 
</p>
<p>
And I&#8217;m not talking Page Three girls. I&#8217;m talking about what happened when the 
McLaren 12C went from Coupe to Spider. 
</p>
<p>
The Coupe impressed everyone, including me. 
</p>
<p>
But despite its technical excellence, I felt it lacked the emotion and glamour 
of a Ferrari. 
</p>
<p>
But in Spider form, roof down, the McLaren gets the extra edge it needed. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Both visually and, more surprisingly, from a driving point of view, it now 
feels like the total package. 
</p>
<p>
When you chop the roof off a supercar, they normally become compromised. But 
not the McLaren. 
</p>
<p>
It feels more composed and the electric roof disappears in 17 seconds. It can 
also be lowered at speeds of up to 19 mph. 
</p>
<p>
Everywhere I went, the Spider turned heads &#8211; it has genuine supercar style to 
match its rivals. 
</p>
<p>
And you want to be noticed at this price. The Spider starts at &#163;195,950 and 
the model I drove was just under &#163;250,000. 
</p>
<p>
Being a McLaren, it really is a tour de force of technical brilliance, as 
you&#8217;d expect from a company with the latest F1 racing tech on hand. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
And you would expect the Spider to have exceptional handling capabilities, 
coming from a firm run by Ron Dennis &#8211; a guy known for his obsession with 
technical perfection and attention to detail. And it does. 
</p>
<p>
You can actually drive the McLaren around town as easily as a supermini. 
</p>
<p>
Unlike many supercars, it is surprisingly relaxing and comfortable to drive. 
</p>
<p>
It only becomes intimidating when you flatten the accelerator and the 3.8litre 
V8 twin turbo engine comes alive. 
</p>
<p>
With 616bhp sitting just behind you, there is also a wall of intoxicating 
noise to go with the thumping performance that sees 0-60mph flash by in a 
blur of 3.4 seconds, while 0-100mph takes just 7.2 seconds and the top speed 
is 207mph. 
</p>
<p>
Performance is maximised by super-slick and rapid paddle changes attached to 
the steering wheel, though you can sit back and enjoy the smooth auto-box 
driving in town traffic. 
</p>
<p>
But the Spider really loves bends and demanding roads. 
</p>
<p>
The faster you go, the more composed and precise it becomes &#8211; to a point that 
is almost dangerous as it makes the average driver seem multi-talented. 
</p>
<p>
The pared-down cabin feels like a cross between an F1 car and a fighter jet, 
with a perfectly sized steering wheel that, like the leather sports seat, 
fits like a glove. 
</p>
<p>
It is luxurious but not flamboyant, apart from the gull wing doors. 
</p>
<p>
Three days with the Spider confirmed McLaren are learning fast. It is a match 
for the Ferrari 458 Italia &#8211; and that is a very big statement to make.

<![CDATA[<p>
IT was one of the most spectacular car launches ever. 
</p>
<p>
A new model billed the Best Car In The World, a singing superstar and the 
planet&#8217;s most advanced aeroplane. 
</p>
<p>
The Mercedes S-Class lived up to its billing &#8211; it&#8217;s the first car that can 
drive itself and is a limo capable of 64mpg. 
</p>
<p>
And the Merc was perfectly in tune as its first passenger was Alicia Keys. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
The American singer was the star turn at the launch show in Germany. 
</p>
<p>
There was even a thunderstorm as the car drove down the runway and into a 
hangar at the Hamburg HQ of the Airbus A380, in front of the 800 invited VIP 
quests. 
</p>
<p>
<i>Here&#8217;s the full review from the unveiling of the new Mercedes S-Class </i>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>CALLING a new vehicle &#8220;the best car in the world&#8221; has to be either 
misplaced arrogance or justified confidence. </b>
</p>
<p>
That is the risk Mercedes took by making the claim at the VIP launch of their 
flagship S-Class model in Hamburg. 
</p>
<p>
Just as well, then, that the car appears to have all the qualities to back up 
the bold boast, including being the first one that can drive itself in heavy 
traffic! 
</p>
<p>
The steering assist and stop-go pilot mean it can steer, brake and drive 
itself automatically at speeds of up to 30mph in traffic jams. 
</p>
<p>
The driver can, of course, always regain control. 
</p>
<p>
The car also has a brake system that detects pedestrians or vehicles in front 
in city traffic, and can self-brake to avoid a crash. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
The system can also recognise a potential rear collision and put on the rear 
hazard lights. 
</p>
<p>
These factors justify another Merc claim &#8212; that the S-Class is &#8220;the safest car 
on the road&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>
And how about this for a ground-breaking development? 
</p>
<p>
It has the first car suspension with &#8220;eyes&#8221;. It uses camera scanners &#8212; dubbed 
Magic Body Control &#8212; to detect bumps on the road ahead. 
</p>
<p>
When it sees one the vehicle then automatically adjusts the dampers and 
suspension on each wheel to a firmer or softer setting to give a magic 
carpet ride across potholed surfaces &#8212; perfect for UK roads. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s the most economical luxury limo, with a range of hybrid diesel/petrol 
engines capable of 64mpg &#8212; that&#8217;s better than most superminis. 
</p>
<p>
Another promise is first-class aircraft levels of comfort and luxury, which 
was why Mercedes chose the German home of the Airbus A380, the world&#8217;s most 
advanced aircraft, for the launch. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
That&#8217;s presumably also why stars such as singer Alicia Keys were happy to be 
there to endorse it. 
</p>
<p>
I can vouch for the unadulterated luxury of the roomy, sumptuously soft 
leather seats. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
The backrests recline to 45 degrees, the heated seats have an energising 
massage function and even the armrests can be heated or cooled. But it&#8217;s not 
all about relaxation. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
You get working desks in the back, plus two DVD screens which can be linked to 
the web for connectivity, along with a mega-music system, all of which can 
be operated from an app on your phone. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
There&#8217;s even a climate control with air balance and an active perfuming system 
with four different smells to waft around the cabin! 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Also, 115 years after cars were first fitted with electric headlamps, the 
S-Class is the first car since to have virtually NO lightbulbs &#8212; although 
its 500 LEDs mean it won&#8217;t leave you in the dark. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
The new S-Class is very much the Airbus of motoring. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
It&#8217;s a trailblazing, advanced trendsetter for business high-fliers when they 
are on the ground. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Over the years the car has been the best-selling luxury limo. 
</p>
<p>
Alongside its high-spec standards it has always been at the forefront of 
technology, a winning recipe which has made it the favourite wheels of 
executives and politicians. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
And the new model has much more road presence with its prominent and upright 
chrome grille, long, raking headlights leading to a long bonnet and a sleek, 
coupe-like roofline. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
We will have to wait to test drive the S-Class to see if it delivers &#8220;the best 
driving experience&#8221;, but no other car can touch it for technological 
innovations and safety. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Only a Rolls or Bentley challenge it for out-and-out luxury &#8212; this is 
five-star motoring. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
On sale in the UK this autumn, the price is yet to be confirmed but expect a 
range from &#163;65,000 all the way up to &#163;170,000. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
A fitting price for a car Mercedes believe to be the best in the world.

<tol-text:story>
<![CDATA[<p>
PERFORMANCE comes in many different guises. 
</p>
<p>
We&#8217;ve just driven three VW models, all promising a little extra performance 
but all with totally different personalities. 
</p>
<p>
For starters, we drove the Polo BlueGT, which sounds very sporty but is 
actually more warm than hot hatch. 
</p>
<p>
Then we turned up the heat a little to a Beetle Sport with a 2-litre turbo. 
</p>
<p>
But we saved the best for last &#8211; VW&#8217;s big daddy of performance, the latest 
version of the Golf GTI. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>
ROAD TEST: VW POLO BLUEGT 
</h4>
<p>
AS with the Golf, the Polo&#8217;s success is based around the desirability of the 
badge compared to its rivals. 
</p>
<p>
And like the Golf, the smaller Polo also gets a hot GTI version but, priced at 
around &#163;20,000, it&#8217;s a very small niche. 
</p>
<p>
Which is why Polo have brought out a slightly less powerful BlueGT version, at 
a slightly more affordable &#163;18,020. 
</p>
<p>
And the Polo could appeal to more buyers because it&#8217;s a nice mix of reasonable 
performance, sporty-ish looks but, equally important, very impressive fuel 
economy. 
</p>
<p>
That&#8217;s because the BlueGT gets VW&#8217;s cylinder de-activation system on its 
1.4-litre turbo petrol engine, which basically cuts the cylinders down to 
three when you&#8217;re cruising. 
</p>
<p>
It still performs like a baby GT when you flatten the accelerator: 0-62mph in 
7.9 seconds is nippy for a supermini and the top speed is 130mph. 
</p>
<p>
It also handles OK and fits into band B, which means zero road tax in the 
first year and &#163;20 afterwards. 
</p>
<p>
But drive the GT sensibly and it gets close to 60mpg, which is a pretty 
reasonable compromise as fuel economy is increasingly becoming more relevant 
than performance. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h4>
ROAD TEST: VW BEETLE 
</h4>
<p>
YOU tend to think of the Beetle as being much more about posing than 
performance. 
</p>
<p>
But the third generation of the Beetle not only looks much sharper than the 
previous girly model, it also drives better. 
</p>
<p>
Mind you, that&#8217;s not saying a great deal. 
</p>
<p>
Affair It has to be said, the last version was a pretty lame affair. 
</p>
<p>
And although the new Sport version won&#8217;t ever get you excited, it is now quick 
enough to make the driving experience a more enjoyable affair. 
</p>
<p>
That is particularly true if you go for the 200bhp 2-litre turbo petrol engine 
that returns a respectable 0-62mph in 7.5 seconds and has a top speed of 
140mph. 
</p>
<p>
But fuel economy drops to just below 39mpg. 
</p>
<p>
The handling fits only into the &#8220;adequate&#8221; category because, despite its Sport 
badge, the Beetle is still really all about totally individualistic style. 
</p>
<p>
You pay for the style and the extra performance of the Sport with a &#163;22,995 
tag after a recent price rise, which means you really have to like the way 
this new Beetle looks. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<h4>
ROAD TEST: VW GOLF GTI 
</h4>
<p>
IT was the first family hatchback with the handling and performance of a 
sports car. 
</p>
<p>
Volkswagen&#8217;s reward for creating the Golf GTI has been sales of nearly two 
million since 1975... and a car that has become an icon. 
</p>
<p>
Over the years since its launch, the GTI has acquired legendary status and 
become the king of the hot hatches. Its appeal has never waned, especially 
in the UK where VW have sold more than 225,000. 
</p>
<p>
<i>And after two days&#8217; driving on mountain roads and a race circuit in 
Provence, I can tell you it sets a new benchmark.</i>
</p>
<p>
Which is probably just as well because it faces stiff competition from the 
very good Focus ST, the Astra VXR and a smoky new Seat Leon Cupra, on the 
way soon. 
</p>
<p>
The success of the GTI has always been its dual personality. It&#8217;s a car that 
is as happy trundling down to the supermarket as it is driving at speed on 
twisty roads or even a racing circuit. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s a car that can do everything with style, including the understated looks. 
Now it just does it better and, being a VW, it holds its price better than 
any of its rivals. 
</p>
<p>
The vital element is an amazingly smooth, quick and refined 2-litre turbo 
engine that delivers 220bhp, with 0-62mph in 6.5 seconds, linked to a slick 
six-speed manual or a DSG semi-automatic gearbox. 
</p>
<p>
The brilliant thing about the GTI is that it not only feels faster than the 
mere figures, it feels so effortless. There is no wild torque steer under 
hard acceleration, thanks to a new steering system. 
</p>
<p>
And the ride is like a magic carpet over bad surfaces &#8212; perfect for UK roads &#8212; 
the result of developments to the suspension and great sculpted sports seats 
in classic tartan upholstery. 
</p>
<p>
The cabin is very Volkswagen, which means top quality materials. 
</p>
<p>
But you also get nice touches such as red ambient lighting and a chunky sports 
steering wheel to go with the seats and drilled aluminium pedals. 
</p>
<p>
Standard equipment includes park assist with a rear view camera, an excellent 
touchscreen satnav, 19in alloy wheels and individual climate control air 
con, plus you get bags of space for four adults and luggage. 
</p>
<p>
There is the option of a Performance Pack, costing an extra &#163;980, that adds 
10bhp plus bigger brakes and a limited-slip differential for drivers who 
like driving on the limit. 
</p>
<p>
But as I said, the GTI is not just about performance. 
</p>
<p>
Emissions are down to 139g/km for the manual and fuel economy is impressive at 
between 44 and 47mpg, though closer to 40mpg driven hard. Insurance has 
dropped 5 groups. 
</p>
<p>
The Golf GTI has never been the cheapest but it&#8217;s still good value, from 
&#163;25,845 to &#163;28,895 for the Performance Pack version. 
</p>
<p>
But don&#8217;t take my word for it. 
</p>
<p>
<i>Take a test drive. I guarantee you will be blown away by this class act.</i>

<tol-text:story>
<![CDATA[<p>
MONDEO MAN used to be the politicians&#8217; barometer for the mood of the country 
at election time. 
</p>
<p>
Now the car he drives is caught up in motoring politics &#8212; over Ford&#8217;s plans to 
close a Belgian factory. 
</p>
<p>
Mondeo Man should be driving an all-new model but, instead, is being offered 
two special-edition versions of the current one. 
</p>
<p>
Ford have been forced to delay the stunning new version until late next year 
due to their factory dispute. 
</p>
<p>
The Mondeo is built in the Belgian city of Genk but Ford want to shut that 
plant and move production to Spain. 
</p>
<p>
But that can&#8217;t go ahead until Ford have completed formal consultations with 
the Belgian government and trade unions, who are fighting the plan. 
</p>
<p>
They need to do this to comply with Belgian law, although the closure is 
certain to go ahead regardless. 
</p>
<p>
Ford are also in the middle of talks with union leaders in the UK over their 
decision to shut down the company&#8217;s Transit works in Southampton and a 
components plant in Dagenham, Essex, this year. 
</p>
<p>
Again, there is strong resistance to the plans. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
The proposed closures in both Belgium and the UK are part of Ford&#8217;s plans to 
curb major losses in their European operation. 
</p>
<p>
They forecast &#163;1.3billion losses for the full year, with those for the first 
quarter already up from &#163;96million to &#163;298million. 
</p>
<p>
Which is why the new Mondeo remains under wraps here, despite the fact this 
British/ European designed and engineered car has been on sale in America 
for nearly a year and will shortly be hitting showrooms in China. 
</p>
<p>
The new Mondeo is getting rave reviews in America &#8212; not surprisingly because 
it looks like an Aston Martin from the front and has German-style quality on 
the inside. 
</p>
<p>
But with the new car not due here until late next year, Ford have been forced 
to bring out two special-edition versions and revamp the current range to 
keep the Mondeo competitive until then. 
</p>
<p>
<i>We tested one of the specials, the new entry-level Mondeo Graphite, to see 
how it performs.</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>FIRST DRIVE: MONDEO GRAPHITE</b>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
FEW mainstream cars have aged better than the Mondeo. 
</p>
<p>
Of its mainstream rivals, only the new Mazda 6 really outshines it in the 
style department. 
</p>
<p>
But the Mondeo is now six years old and that&#8217;s elderly by car standards, where 
mainstream models are changed every five years. 
</p>
<p>
The Mondeo, though, has had a major mid-life face-lift. 
</p>
<p>
And Ford have consistently updated its engine technology. 
</p>
<p>
In fact, the 1.6litre diesel Graphite model is a cracker. I got just over 
50mpg driving the car hard and Ford&#8217;s official figure is 65mpg. Driven with 
a light right foot, 60mpg would be realistic. 
</p>
<p>
With an engine that&#8217;s part of a topnotch driving package, that&#8217;s great news 
for a big family. 
</p>
<p>
The responsive steering, composed handling, smooth ride and sweet six-speed 
gearbox make the Mondeo the ideal drive, whether you&#8217;re on a long motorway 
run or coping with city traffic. 
</p>
<p>
This is why the model is such a hit with company car drivers who spend hours 
behind the wheel, making the car rather like a second home. 
</p>
<p>
The other reason the Mondeo scores high is because of its low CO2 emissions. 
With 112 g/km, that reduces Benefit In Kind for 20 per cent tax payers to 
&#163;539 and to &#163;1,078 for 40 per cent tax payers. 
</p>
<p>
Additionally, road tax is free for the first year and just &#163;30 a year after 
that, while the excellent fuel economy means you can get close to 1,000 
miles on a full tank. 
</p>
<p>
The Mondeo&#8217;s virtues also include bags of room for five tall adults or parents 
with three kids, while the boot is a cavernous 528litres, increasing to 
1,448 with the rear seats down &#8211; putting it on a par with a big estate. 
</p>
<p>
Last, but by no means least, the Graphite&#8217;s price starts at a competitive 
&#163;15,995, making it &#163;2,000 cheaper than the previous entry Mondeo. 
</p>
<p>
But if you want to really pamper yourself, go for the Titanium X Business 
Edition at &#163;21,995 &#8211; that&#8217;s &#163;1,500 cheaper than the Titanium X it replaces 
and it has more equipment. 
</p>
<p>
So the good news is that the Mondeo remains a very good car and is now even 
better value. The bad news is that Americans are already driving an even 
better new version that won&#8217;t be available here for more than a year.

<![CDATA[<p>
CHINA has become the saviour of the global car industry. 
</p>
<p>
It is now the most important car market in the world after racking up sales of 
more than 19MILLION last year. 
</p>
<p>
That&#8217;s a staggering seven million more motors than were sold in Europe. 
</p>
<p>
Last month alone two million vehicles were snapped up by car-hungry Chinese 
buyers &#8212; the same number of cars that were sold in the UK during 2012. 
</p>
<p>
There are now more than 130 car manufacturers in China, with new ones being 
founded monthly. 
</p>
<p>
Now the powerhouses of the motor world &#8212; America, Germany, South Korea, Japan 
and Britain &#8212; are all desperately trying to cash in on China&#8217;s love affair 
with the car. 
</p>
<p>
Although the rate of growth has slowed for the first time in a decade, there 
is still huge potential for sales as the vast majority of the country&#8217;s 
1.3BILLION inhabitants don&#8217;t have a motor. 
</p>
<p>
Which is why China is also vital to thousands of British car workers who are 
pulling out all the stops to meet demand from the country. 
</p>
<p>
And a famous British name, MG, is leading the British sales boom. 
</p>
<p>
This week&#8217;s Shanghai International Motor Show is one of the most important 
events on the motoring calendar. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
CHINESE motorists bought 80,000 MGs last year &#8211; compared to just over 600 
here. 
</p>
<p>
Life for the famous brand has changed dramatically since William Morris 
founded the firm back in 1924. 
</p>
<p>
After the collapse of MG Rover in 2005, this most British of British car 
brands is slowly rising from the ashes &#8212; but is now very much a Chinese 
affair, owned by SAIC Motor Corporation, China&#8217;s largest car firm and the 
eighth biggest in the world. 
</p>
<p>
SAIC sold 4.49million cars in 2012, more than double the entire UK car market 
for the same period. 
</p>
<p>
The firm have invested millions in MG since they acquired the brand after MG 
Rover&#8217;s demise. 
</p>
<p>
They have built a factory in Shanghai to make MGs and a &#163;10million research 
and design centre to develop new models. 
</p>
<p>
SAIC spokesman Zhu Xiangjun said: &#8220;We think MG is our long-term plan to become 
a global player. The potential is huge and we are happy with the progress it 
is making.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The UK Research And Design Centre in Longbridge, Birmingham, employs just 300 
people and may seem like an outpost. But it plays a key role in developing 
new models. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
SAIC have invested more than &#163;&#189;billion in setting up their UK operation and 
gearing up the old Longbridge MG Rover factory to assemble MGs from kits 
shipped from China. 
</p>
<p>
And despite their relatively small sales, MG are the jewel in SAIC&#8217;s motoring 
empire. 
</p>
<p>
The firm have ambitious long-term plans to make their subsidiary a global 
player once again, with sales across Europe starting in 2015. MGs are 
already sold in 40 countries. 
</p>
<p>
The Chinese firm&#8217;s obsession with the British brand was underlined at the 
Shanghai Show at the weekend. Models in Union Jack dresses and images of UK 
landmarks, plus pictures of the Queen, James Bond and Mr Bean flashed up on 
a big screen as the newest MG was unveiled. 
</p>
<p>
Hundreds of Chinese and international journalists packed the MG stand to 
underline that the British brand still has an attraction to the car world. 
</p>
<p>
And a dramatic new concept, the MG CS, the firm&#8217;s first SUV, showed the 
company are trying hard to change with the times. 
</p>
<p>
MG say the CS is very close to a production version that will go on sale 
within two years in the UK and will rival models such as the Nissan Qashqai. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
MG are also assessing whether to give the go-ahead for their radical Icon 
concept, a cross between a sports car and a coup&#233; that recalls the classic 
MGB from certain angles. 
</p>
<p>
One motor that will be going on sale in the UK later this year is the MG3 
supermini, a car that is already proving a big hit with young Chinese 
customers. 
</p>
<p>
One, Summer Zhuang, a 30-year-old marketing executive from Shanghai, has 
personalised her MG3 with a pink and white colour scheme. 
</p>
<p>
She says the MG3 is seen as a motoring fashion statement in China and adds: 
&#8220;British car brands like MG, Bentley and Land Rover are seen as very trendy 
in China. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I bought the MG because of its size and style. It&#8217;s perfect for driving in 
the city.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
MG&#8217;s UK sales and marketing director Guy Jones wants to repeat the MG3&#8217;s 
Chinese success with young British buyers. 
</p>
<p>
He sees it going up against the Mini and Citroen DS3 as a small car with lots 
of personalisation. 
</p>
<p>
He adds: &#8220;I see the MG3 appealing not only to traditional MG buyers but also 
attracting new, younger buyers to the brand. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It&#8217;s a stylish small car with a distinctive cheeky style that&#8217;s also bigger 
than most superminis.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Guy says the MG3&#8217;s other appeal will be its affordability when it goes on sale 
in the autumn, although he wouldn&#8217;t give official prices. 
</p>
<p>
I expect it to start at around &#163;10,000 and go up to &#163;15,000. 
</p>
<p>
This week I got an exclusive first drive of the MG3 in Shanghai and reckon it 
will be a contender in the supermini sector. 
</p>
<p>
It has the styling to appeal to buyers of all ages, with an eye-catching face 
and sharp rear view. On the inside it has a smart, trendy feel, with touches 
of white trim finish. Plus it really does have good space for five tall 
adults plus a useful boot. 
</p>
<p>
Its 1.5litre petrol engine is adequate but handles very well and has been 
tuned for British drivers at MG&#8217;s UK centre. 
</p>
<p>
And if it&#8217;s priced between &#163;10,000 and &#163;15,000, it will attract new customers 
wanting something different and intrigued by the MG name, along with 
traditional fans still in love with the brand. 
</p>
<p>
At the moment MG may seem like a token gesture in Britain, given their 
illustrious past and just 236 UK sales so far this year. 
</p>
<p>
But I saw enough in China to believe they will once again be a force, though 
it will take time. 
</p>
<p>
And what they&#8217;ve achieved already is remarkable, because despite the MG name 
and history, this is an entirely new car company being built from scratch.

<![CDATA[<p>
BIG sales in China are playing a key role in keeping British car production 
lines rolling &#8211; safeguarding many thousands of jobs. 
</p>
<p>
Chinese consumers see famous British brands &#8212; like the MG and the iconic Mini 
&#8212; as a statement of their success, proof that they&#8217;ve &#8220;made it&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>
With more than a million millionaires in China, the country has a host of 
potential customers for our premium/luxury car firms. 
</p>
<p>
China is now the biggest sales market for Britain&#8217;s biggest car firm, Jaguar 
Land Rover, who are building a factory there to make up to 130,000 cars a 
year for Chinese buyers. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
JLR have signed a joint venture with Chinese manufacturers Chery and they are 
together investing &#163;1.8billion in a new factory that will start producing 
Land Rovers and Jags next year. They have already hired 400 workers. 
</p>
<p>
Last year China became the biggest global market for JLR, with 71,940 cars 
sold. The firm set another record for China last month. 
</p>
<p>
They now have 116 dealerships in China with plans to grow that to 163. 
</p>
<p>
JLR unveiled both the new Range Rover Sport and the Jaguar F-Type at Shanghai 
&#8212; models guaranteed to boost sales to close to 100,000 this year. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
JLR chief executive Ralf Speth said: &#8220;China is now JLR&#8217;s biggest market. Our 
commitment to the Chinese market is a business imperative.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
One in every four Rolls-Royce cars sold in the world are now bought by Chinese 
customers. And China is vying with the US to be their biggest single market. 
</p>
<p>
Mega-rich Chinese customers see owning a Roller as the ultimate status symbol. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Chinese millionaires were putting down deposits for the firm&#8217;s new Wraith &#8212; 
despite a price tag of more than &#163;500,000 &#8212; as soon as it was unveiled at 
Shanghai. 
</p>
<p>
Chief executive Torsten Muller-Otvos said the reaction from potential buyers 
had exceeded expectations, adding that the firm were looking for further 
growth and expanding their dealer network in China. 
</p>
<p>
And the Rolls boss exclusively revealed to The Sun that the next new model 
would be a convertible version of the Ghost. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;We would be crazy not to,&#8221; he admitted. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Aston Martin needed an army of security guards to control the crowds trying to 
see a special centenary edition of their new Rapide S model. 
</p>
<p>
And several Chinese fans put down deposits for the Rapide S despite it costing 
upwards of &#163;375,000 excluding taxes. 
</p>
<p>
Boss Ulrich Bez says Aston expect a quarter of their sales to soon come from 
China, which is now their fastest-growing market. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Another famous luxury British brand enjoying booming sales in China is 
Bentley. 
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s now their second biggest market after America, with sales up 23 per cent 
last year. 
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s also the biggest single market for the Bentley Flying Spur, accounting 
for 50 per cent of global sales &#8212; which is why their stand was swamped with 
potential buyers for the new Spur. 
</p>
<p>
Bentley&#8217;s boss Wolfgang Schreiber told The Sun: &#8220;China is a key market and we 
have significant expansion plans, including increasing our dealer network to 
45 by 2015.&#8221;

<![CDATA[<p>
ROADS are the indispensable backbone of Britain. 
</p>
<p>
But right now they&#8217;re crumbling into a minefield of potholes, disrepair and 
chaos. 
</p>
<p>
These are the same roads British drivers pay &#163;46billion a year in motoring 
taxes to use. 
</p>
<p>
In return, the Government are investing just &#163;6.3billion on major motorway and 
trunk road schemes and providing councils with around &#163;3billion between 2011 
and 2015 to maintain the roads. 
</p>
<p>
Transport Minister Norman Baker says a highways maintenance efficiency 
programme has been set up to help local councils deliver a &#8220;first-class 
service, and at the same time save money&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
But Mr Baker must be driving on different roads to the rest of us if he thinks 
a first-class service is being delivered. 
</p>
<p>
The reality is that the condition of many of our roads is what you&#8217;d expect in 
a Third World country rather than a powerhouse of Europe. 
</p>
<p>
One in five local authority roads across England are reported to be in poor 
condition, with just five years&#8217; life remaining. 
</p>
<p>
The average road in England is fully re-surfaced just once every 54 years. And 
our vital motorway network is a sea of cones and daily disruption, with only 
nine major schemes planned for 2013/14 nationwide. 
</p>
<p>
A new report has revealed it would take &#163;10.5billion to get our roads back to 
just a &#8220;reasonable&#8221; condition. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
The ALARM survey by road repair body the Asphalt Industry Alliance, which 75 
per cent of local authorities responsible for roads in England and Wales 
participated in, says it would take 12 years to clear the backlog with 
adequate investment. 
</p>
<p>
But the report concludes that with a yearly cash shortfall for maintenance 
work of &#163;831million, our roads are just going to get worse. 
</p>
<p>
The Government&#8217;s lack of investment is costing small and medium-sized 
businesses &#163;5billion a year in wasted staff time, production delays, 
increased fuel consumption and vehicle repairs, according to research by 
pollsters YouGov. 
</p>
<p>
And the Government paid &#163;32million compensation to motorists last year for 
damage to vehicles because of the state of our roads, plus a further 
&#163;13million to administer the payments. 
</p>
<p>
The worst damage is to tyres, with an estimated 4.3million repairs last year, 
plus 2.9million cases of suspension damage and 2.4million wrecked wheels. 
</p>
<p>
But this is just the tip of the iceberg as the majority of motorists don&#8217;t 
make claims. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Last year, local authorities filled in 2.2million potholes, but after a 
nightmare winter of bad weather that figure is set to get ever higher. 
</p>
<p>
Geoff Dunning of the Road Haulage Association blames the Government&#8217;s false 
economy of stopgap repairs to our roads. 
</p>
<p>
He says: &#8220;We are simply not repairing our roads properly. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The Government need to invest more money on our roads and give our transport 
system the priority it deserves as the lifeline for British industry.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>
<i>Experts say filling potholes costs on average &#163;58 each &#8212; which works out at 
least 20 times more expensive than resurfacing a whole road.</i>
</p>
<p>
The Highways Agency are investing in some major schemes on motorways and trunk 
roads, along with &#8220;pinch-point programmes&#8221; that include widening schemes to 
remove traffic bottlenecks. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
But many experts believe the money spent on patching roads up is actually 
making the problem worse. 
</p>
<p>
The AA motoring organisation&#8217;s president Edmund King says that many of our 
roads are now a &#8220;national embarrassment&#8221;, especially considering the huge 
amount we pay in motoring taxes. 
</p>
<p>
And Alan Mackenzie of the Asphalt Industry Alliance said: &#8220;The reality is that 
we are simply not investing enough in the maintenance of our roads. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;We need the Government to provide major additional investment in long-term 
preventative maintenance and not just short-term reactive work.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>
And a quote from one local authority official in the recent ALARM survey sums 
up perfectly the crisis we are facing. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The structural condition of our roads is a ticking timebomb.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>
The irony is that if the Government are willing to invest heavily in serious 
maintenance and new road investment &#8212; like their obsession with the High 
Speed Rail link &#8212; it would create thousands of jobs and boost the economy. 
</p>
<p>
The message is clear, Mr Cameron. It&#8217;s time for action not words. 
</p>
<p>
Otherwise your legacy will be a broken-down road network that leads to 
nowhere. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Here's Ken's letter to David Cameron in full:
</p>
<h4>
<b><i>Dear Prime Minister,</i></b>
</h4>
<p>
This week I am giving you a challenge on behalf of the 35million motorists of 
the UK.
</p>
<p>
The challenge is that you spend a day with me driving the roads of Britain to 
experience first hand how they have become a national embarrassment. 
</p>
<p>
British motorists now pay &#163;46billion for the privilege of driving on some of 
the worst roads in Europe. 
</p>
<p>
Of that just &#163;8billion goes back into our roads, shared between motorways and 
local highways.
</p>
<p>
A major new report reveals that it would cost &#163;10.5billion to get our road 
network back into just a &#8220;reasonable condition&#8221;, and that it will take <b>12 
YEARS</b> to clear the road repair back-log in England and Wales.
</p>
<p>
As there is currently a shortfall of &#163;831million a year for highways repairs, 
there is not a hope in hell of our roads ever getting to a reasonable state.
</p>
<p>
Your Government are watching the disintegration of our road network, into a 
crumbling patchwork quilt of potholes and a sea of cones, because of totally 
inadequate funding in the roads. 
</p>
<p>
And while our highways turn into the roads from hell your Government is 
pressing ahead with a multi-billion investment into a new rail link, while 
neglecting the roads that are the backbone of the economy.
</p>
<p>
Our roads are not only vital to industry but also support our daily lives.
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s time the Government stopped using motorists as a cash cow and gave 
us a road network worthy of a country that&#8217;s meant to be one of the 
leaders in Europe.
</p>
<p>
An immediate way to put our roads back on track would be to invest a 
substantial amount of the &#163;46billion you take from motorists in taxation 
directly back into the roads. I await your reply.
</p>
<p>
<i>Yours Sincerely</i>
</p>
<h4>
<b><i>Ken Gibson, Motoring Editor</i></b>
</h4>
<p>
<b>NOW SEND US YOUR PICS:</b>
</p>
<p>
HAVE you got the worst potholes in Britain? 
</p>
<p>
Has your car been badly damaged by our nightmare roads? 
</p>

<tol-text:story>
<![CDATA[<p>
THIS week we have a double bill of fast and faster, with a hot hatch and a 
red-hot sports car. 
</p>
<p>
The Peugeot 208 GTi is the perfect illustration that you don&#8217;t need to be big 
to offer driving thrills. It may only have a 1.6litre turbo-charged engine, 
but it confirms hot hatches remain one of the more affordable ways of 
getting plenty of driving pleasure. 
</p>
<p>
Any car carrying the Porsche badge guarantees the driver serious enjoyment and 
the new Cayman S is very worthy of that badge. Plenty of supercar buyers 
will pay triple the price of the Cayman but I bet they won&#8217;t get a lot more 
enjoyment. It is an exceptional car, hard to fault. 
</p>
<p>
My road tests reveal these were two of the best drives I&#8217;ve had this year &#8211; I 
was gutted to hand back the keys. 
</p>
<h4>
ROAD TEST: PEUGEOT 208 GTi 
</h4>
<p>
</p>
<p>
ONE of the hardest tricks in the motoring book is to replace an icon. 
</p>
<p>
Car firms know they are on a hiding to nothing &#8212; get it wrong and they will be 
slaughtered, get it right and it&#8217;s what people expected anyway. 
</p>
<p>
And that is exactly the dilemma that Peugeot faced with the 208 GTi, the 
latest model to attempt to recapture the magic of the iconic 205 GTi of the 
1980s. 
</p>
<p>
Peugeot&#8217;s last two attempts, with the 206 and 207 GTi models, both ended in 
failure with cars that didn&#8217;t get close to the original. So there is big 
pressure on the 208 GTi, especially with very impressive new rivals in the 
Fiesta and Renault Clio. 
</p>
<p>
But Peugeot did have a good base to start at. The standard 208 is a runaway 
success, with 300,000 sold in just a year, making it Europe&#8217;s best-selling 
supermini. 
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;m old enough to remember the Eighties 205 GTi &#8212; a workmate owned one and I 
spent plenty of time in both the driver and passenger seat, so I can give a 
realistic assessment of the 208 in comparison. 
</p>
<p>
Obviously, the 208 has the considerable advantage of nearly 30 years of 
continual advances in technology and design, which is also why it costs 
&#163;18,895 compared to &#163;6,295 for the 1981 205 GTi. 
</p>
<p>
By hot hatch standards the 208 GTi actually looks a little understated, but I 
like the more restrained approach that gives the Peugeot a touch of extra 
class which you don&#8217;t expect from a pocket rocket. 
</p>
<p>
The LED running lights, a chrome and matt black grille, deeper spoiler at the 
front and chrome wing mirrors still give it enough added attitude to stand 
out. 
</p>
<p>
Bigger alloys, a rear roof spoiler and neat double exhaust pipes at the rear 
also add drama, but the best touch is the GTi logo cut in to the rear C 
pillar, just like the 205. 
</p>
<p>
The interior definitely fits the image, with part-leather sports seats and a 
racy red, black and satin chrome colour scheme, with red trim around the 
main instruments, centre console and doors. 
</p>
<p>
A small steering wheel that obscures the instruments, a chunky aluminium gear 
lever and matching pedals all leave you in no doubt that this is a hot 
supermini that comes with all the gadgets and connectivity apps via a 
seven-inch screen. 
</p>
<p>
With the GTi Peugeot have rediscovered the fun factor in some style. The more 
time I spent throwing the GTi around mountain roads in France the bigger my 
smile became. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
The 1.6litre turbo engine is a gem. Shared with the Mini Cooper S, it pumps 
out just short of 200bhp and delivers 0-62mph in 6.8 seconds and a top speed 
of 143mph. 
</p>
<p>
At first, like the rest of the car, it sounds a little understated, with a low 
rumble of noise, but the quicker you go the sweeter the engine sounds, 
without ever becoming tiring. It&#8217;s the same with the steering &#8212; the faster 
you go, the more responsive it is. 
</p>
<p>
Best of all, the ride retains a comfort level that you don&#8217;t expect from a hot 
hatch. The 208 GTi is a car you can drive on the limit or simply cruise 
around town. It&#8217;s happy in any road conditions and can switch to suit your 
driving mood, giving you sporty and refined in one package. 
</p>
<p>
Prices start at &#163;18,895, which is nearly &#163;2,000 more than the entry-level 
Fiesta ST, but it has more equipment. Even so, satnav is &#163;400 extra and with 
all the options the price can rise to &#163;21,290, while the Renault goes from 
&#163;18,995 to &#163;19,995. 
</p>
<p>
In truth the three cars are as close dynamically as they are in price and 
performance. If you want old-school rawness and the best price, go for the 
Ford. 
</p>
<p>
If you want a grown-up hot hatch, the Renault fits the bill, but you get a 
less involving auto box instead of a manual. 
</p>
<p>
But the classiest and best all-round package is the 208 GTi. It may lack the 
driving devil of the 205 GTi but it&#8217;s a thoroughly modern hot hatch that 
will be a lot more realistic to live with on a day-to-day basis. 
</p>
<h4>
ROAD TEST: PORSCHE CAYMAN S 
</h4>
<p>
</p>
<p>
THE 911 may be Porsche&#8217;s icon but the firm have a new star. 
</p>
<p>
The Porsche Cayman has just been voted Performance Car Of The Year by a panel 
of World Car Of The Year judges. 
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;m one of the World Car panel who voted for the Cayman ahead of Ferraris and 
the 911. 
</p>
<p>
The reasons are numerous, but the most compelling is the sheer value for money 
the Cayman offers against any other sports car. 
</p>
<p>
The price difference between a Porsche Cayman S at &#163;48,783 and a 911 Carrera 
is a thumping &#163;24,000. Go for the entry-level version and its &#163;39,694 tag is 
an absolute bargain in sports car terms. 
</p>
<p>
But the difference in performance and driving ability between the Cayman S and 
the 911 is so close, even a talented driver would struggle to make it truly 
noticeable. 
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s hardly surprising as they share the same brilliant 3.4litre flat-six 
engine that sees the Cayman S hit 62mph in 4.7 blistering seconds and on to 
175mph. 
</p>
<p>
There&#8217;s now a Sport mode as standard, which quickens the throttle response via 
the rapid six-speed manual gearbox, allowing you to wring the maximum 
performance and entertainment from the ever-willing engine. 
</p>
<p>
The Cayman also shares the same amazing levels of grip and cornering of the 
Carrera but to me feels even more composed, and compared to the old model it 
feels less twitchy and less demanding to drive on long journeys. 
</p>
<p>
Put together, it makes the Cayman one of the best cars in the world to drive. 
It&#8217;s a car that can lift you after a bad day at work like few others can. 
</p>
<p>
The latest Cayman is 1&#189;in longer at 14ft 4&#189;in but its height drops by &#189;in, 
which gives it more road presence, along with a sharper new design. 
</p>
<p>
That design is a classic Porsche example of subtle evolution, led by dazzling 
new twin LED headlights, wide, flared wheel arches and more pronounced rear 
wings, giving the Cayman striking proportions. 
</p>
<p>
Its interior also steps things up. Not only does the extra length give you 
more space, especially shoulder room, but the quality of all the materials 
is now top-drawer. 
</p>
<p>
I love the simple but beautifully laid out cabin that feels on a par with 
Porsches costing twice as much. 
</p>
<p>
You don&#8217;t normally think of sports cars as things that give you real value for 
money, but the Cayman is the exception to the rule. 
</p>
<p>
And that&#8217;s what makes it such an outstanding car &#8212; a car that is now at the 
top of its game and one of the best vehicles in the world. 
</p>
<p>
Of course there will always be people happy to pay the extra cash for the 
extra clout of the 911 badge, but for me the Cayman S is now the best 
Porsche on the road.

<![CDATA[<p>
EVER wondered what 007 would drive if he settled down and became a family man? 
</p>
<p>
Wonder no more. Aston Martin this week launched the sensational Rapide S, the 
world&#8217;s most beautiful four-seater sports car. 
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s also the perfect present for Aston Martin to celebrate their 100th 
anniversary this year. 
</p>
<p>
Motors this week has a first drive of the Rapide S on UK roads &#8211; and an 
in-depth interview with the German boss who has transformed the famous 
British firm in the past decade. 
</p>
<h4>
<b>THE BIG INTERVIEW</b>
</h4>
<p>
<b>HE is the man who has done more for Aston Martin than James Bond.</b>
</p>
<p>
For the past 13 years, Ulrich Bez has been the mastermind who turned Aston 
Martin from sporting pretender to the coolest car brand on the planet. 
</p>
<p>
But the German engineer who learned his trade with Porsche and BMW admits: &#8220;I 
didn&#8217;t know anything about Aston when I arrived, I&#8217;d never even driven an 
Aston Martin car.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
He says he was attracted by the brand. 
</p>
<p>
He says: &#8220;Aston Martin cars didn&#8217;t mean anything to me, but it was a brand I 
knew, like most people, because of James Bond. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But I knew if we got the right products it could become a global brand that 
could challenge Ferrari.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Bez also knew he was not everyone&#8217;s choice to be the boss and smiles when he 
remembers a senior executive openly questioning a German being in charge of 
the British brand. 
</p>
<p>
But Bez has a reputation for not only being a brilliant engineer but also a 
perfectionist used to getting his own way and delivering great cars. 
</p>
<p>
His impressive CV includes playing a key role in the development of the 
original BMW 3.5 and 7 Series, followed by the legendary 993 at Porsche. 
</p>
<p>
But Aston was the first time Bez had total control of a car company, albeit 
reporting to their American owners of the time, Ford. 
</p>
<p>
He found a company with a great name but just one sub-standard product, the 
DB7, and two factories &#8212; one a converted barn at Bloxham, Oxon, and the 
other a rundown facility at Newport Pagnell, Bucks. 
</p>
<p>
Today Aston have a state-of-the-art factory at Gaydon, Warks, a line-up of 
glamorous models and instead of selling 600 cars a year they sell nearly 
4,000. 
</p>
<p>
Bez&#8217;s vision has also stretched to Aston&#8217;s first &#163;1million-plus supercar, the 
1-77, Aston&#8217;s first small car in the Cygnet, and their first four-door 
coupe, the Rapide. 
</p>
<p>
The James Bond franchise and 007 himself has fallen back in love with Aston &#8212; 
Daniel Craig picked up his last month. 
</p>
<p>
But it&#8217;s been a turbulent ride on the way. In his first week, Bez caused a 
strike when he banned workers at the Bloxham factory from eating beside the 
cars on the factory floor. 
</p>
<p>
The strike was over in a week as the workers became the first to realise that 
Bez&#8217;s word was now law. 
</p>
<p>
It was the first of many contentious decisions by Bez, all geared to his 
relentless drive for perfection and obsession with the quality he knew was 
needed.
</p>
<p>
Bez&#8217;s assessment after his first drive of the DB7 in 2000 was simple: &#8220;It was 
not up to my standards. I knew we had to immediately improve everything 
about the way we built our cars and their quality.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
His next decision was to postpone the launch of the Vanquish for a year 
because it wasn&#8217;t right. 
</p>
<p>
Then he axed a planned mid-engined Aston and replaced it with the DB9 and the 
V8 Vantage. 
</p>
<p>
But his biggest decision was to start a programme to develop a new body system 
that would allow Aston to make endless different models off the same 
chassis. 
</p>
<p>
Bez also knew he had to give Aston a new, modern design identity to get them 
noticed again. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
He says: &#8220;In 2000, no one apart from enthusiasts knew about Aston Martin 
outside the UK. We had to get a global visibility and I believed that every 
model had to instantly look like an Aston.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
He reveals that he would have liked a ground-breaking SUV model on the road by 
now. But he says the global recession of 2008 hit Aston and their Middle 
Eastern owners hard. 
</p>
<p>
He says: &#8220;The economic situation slowed down the steps we wanted to take and 
put us back years. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;Of course I would like an Aston SUV, it is very important.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Bez has a clear vision of the next five years, with a target of 7,000 sales a 
year based on the core sports models such as the DB9, Vanquish, Vantage and 
newly face-lifted Rapide S, plus hopefully an SUV. 
</p>
<p>
Ironically, the most German of Germans, Ulrich Bez believes his biggest 
influence at Aston has been one thing. 
</p>
<p>
He says: &#8220;Aston Martin now stands for the best of British and people love the 
firm because it&#8217;s British, and that is my biggest pleasure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
At the age of 70, Bez is clearly not the long-term leader for Aston and he 
says he will be happy to hand over the reins. 
</p>
<p>
He says: &#8220;If there is somebody with the personality, character and vision to 
be the front man for Aston, that is fine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
They will have a mighty tough act to follow. 
</p>
<h4>
<b>ROAD TEST: ASTON MARTIN RAPIDE S</b>
</h4>
<p>
<b>I LIKE cars that live up to their name and the Rapide S does &#8211; big time.</b>
</p>
<p>
The S stands for Sport, a commodity this car has by the bucket-load. 
</p>
<p>
It also happens to be the most beautiful four-seater sports car in the world &#8211; 
but it now has a much more assertive face thanks to a gaping and menacing 
grille. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
This sets the sporting tone for the Rapide S that is rounded off by an 
aggressive rear end, featuring a boot lid flip that counteracts lift at high 
speeds. 
</p>
<p>
And high speed is what the new Rapide S has been built for &#8211; with power from 
the 6litre V12 engine boosted from 470bhp to 550bhp, cutting the 0 to 62mph 
time to 5.2 seconds and blasting the top speed up to 190mph. 
</p>
<p>
The engine sounds sublime &#8211; a deep, glorious burble that explodes into a 
raging roar when you flatten the accelerator. 
</p>
<p>
To complete the impressive figures, despite the extra power the Rapide S is 
more economical at 19.9mpg and CO2 emissions have been cut to 332g/km. 
</p>
<p>
Engineers have also worked hard to improve the stability of the car at high 
speeds and a test drive in the Cotswolds underlined it was very much mission 
accomplished. 
</p>
<p>
The Rapide S has a balance and agility that defy its 5,020mm length and it 
handles twisty, demanding country roads with the agility of a pure two-seat 
sports car. 
</p>
<p>
Luxury Four people can do long journeys at well in excess of 100mph in 
silence, although the intimate back seats remain best for children or small 
adults because the S is not really a saloon car. 
</p>
<p>
But anyone sitting inside the Rapide S will feel special as they are bathed in 
luxury with sports seats finished in a unique black and red interweaved 
perforated leather alongside carbon fibre and piano black trim. 
</p>
<p>
In many ways, the new Rapide S is the perfect example of Ulrich Bez&#8217;s Aston 
Martin &#8211; a compelling mix of beauty, luxury and power with just a dash of 
four-seat practicality. All you need is &#163;144,950 to buy one. 
</p>
<p>
But the best news is that production of the Rapide S has been moved back to 
Gaydon, Warks, from Austria, making it very good news for British jobs.

<![CDATA[<p>
THE Cat&#8217;s out the bag... and so is it&#8217;s Range Rover Sport stablemate. 
</p>
<p>
Scotland will once again wow a global motor show next week when Jaguar unveil 
their most sensational limo yet in New York &#8212; the XJR, below. 
</p>
<p>
The R is the work of Jag&#8217;s Dumfries-born head of design Ian Callum and his 
team and will be a star attraction in the Big Apple. 
</p>
<p>
But the other big news is the <b>LEAKED</b> first picture of co-JLR star Range 
Rover Sport. 
</p>
<p>
The Sport has been cloaked in secrecy before a big showbiz-style unveiling in 
New York next Wednesday. 
</p>
<p>
But while the Sport was getting prepared for its launch, an employee, assigned 
to tint its windows, leaked the pictures online.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Land Rover bosses in the UK are currently investigating how the leak was 
allowed to happen but have confirmed that it will not affect their 
&#8220;spectacular&#8221; debut showpiece of the Sport on the streets of Manhatten will 
go ahead next week. 
</p>
<p>
Range Rover are also promising a major A-lister will drive the new Sport for 
the launch, which will be broadcast online to a worldwide audience. 
</p>
<p>
The new Sport will be the fastest ever Range Rover and finally live up to its 
athletic name. Prices are expected to start around &#163;55,000. 
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the Jag XJR will rival the Rangie for top billing. 
</p>
<p>
The XJR boasts a stonking 542bhp supercharged 5litre V8. Jaguar have only 
released one picture, revealing a new bodykit, a set of bespoke alloys and 
some trademark R styling touches, such as the red Jaguar badge in the 
grille. 
</p>
<p>
There are no performance figures yet but Jaguar are promising a bespoke 
chassis, with Adrian Hallmark, Global Brand Director at Jaguar claiming it 
will deliver &#8220;new levels of dynamic ability in a luxury saloon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The price is expected to be around &#163;110,000.

<![CDATA[<p>
RENAULT are back. 
</p>
<p>
That&#8217;s the bold message employees are being told to use by new UK MD Ken 
Ramirez. 
</p>
<p>
The Puerto Rican &#8212; who joined the firm in February after various roles in 
Latin America and Japan with sister firm Nissan &#8212; oozes positivity, and he 
needs it after a difficult year for the French giants. 
</p>
<p>
In 2012 UK sales were down a whopping <b>40 PER CENT</b>, to just under 
41,000. Across Europe they slumped by six per cent. But Renault are on a 
mission to revitalise their brand after ruthlessly ditching loss-making 
models like Laguna, Espace and Wind. 
</p>
<p>
The new era began with their most important car &#8212; the excellent new 
fourth-generation Clio &#8212; and we&#8217;ve just had a first drive of the 
equally-impressive Renaultsport versions. 
</p>
<p>
Two of the next new models will be crossovers to rival Nissan&#8217;s Juke and 
Qashqai &#8212; beginning with the striking Captur revealed at the Geneva show 
last week. 
</p>
<p>
Ramirez&#8217;s belief is backed by the new Clio, Captur and he wants to see Renault 
move &#8220;upmarket&#8221;. He also told me that the successful launch of the new Dacia 
budget brand will play a vital role in helping the French brand ditch sales 
of their models at significantly discounted prices. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Ramirez said: &#8220;We believe that Renault should be an aspirational brand and 
discounting undermines that policy. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But that&#8217;s where Dacia plays a vital role. Every new Renault should be a car 
that people aspire to buy new &#8212; and are willing to pay a non-discounted 
price for. If you want a quality, low-price car, then buy a Dacia. If you 
want a mainstream quality offering, then buy a Renault.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
<i>Ramirez also believes that, in the UK, the Clio and soon-to-arrive Captur 
illustrate how good Renault&#8217;s future can be.</i>
</p>
<p>
He added: &#8220;In some markets Dacia has helped Renault enormously with sales 
volumes. But in the UK the fourth-generation Clio and Captur have arrived 
just in time to keep us a very strong brand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
<i>There is also a chance that Renault could look at a four-pronged sales 
assault with Dacia, Renault and then adding a sports brand like Alpine and 
premium division which echoes Inifiniti&#8217;s role at stablemates Nissan.</i>
</p>
<p>
The Captur has success written all over it and is built on the same platform 
that underpins the Clio and hugely-successful Juke. 
</p>
<p>
The petrol and diesel engine range will be carried over from the Clio, with 
the headline figure being a diesel which will return emissions of just 
96g/km. It goes on sale in the UK in June priced from around &#163;13,000. 
</p>
<p>
Renault have also improved their Scenics. First up is the Scenic XMOD which is 
their compact MPV getting an SUV makeover. It still has the typically 
MPV-shaped body of the Scenic but now gets Renault&#8217;s new in-your-face family 
front end, incorporating the angled narrow grille and large Renault badge 
that graces the front of the new Clio. 
</p>
<p>
Prices are expected to rise by &#163;800 over the current Scenic MPV, which starts 
at &#163;18,335. The Grand Scenic has also been tweaked and when it goes on sale 
later this year, prices are expected to remain close to the current &#163;19,735. 
</p>
<p>
Renault are also putting a family of electric models on sale this year, from 
the two-seat Twizy to a Kangoo electric van. But the vital one is the 
stunning Zoe supermini EV, with similar styling to the Clio, with prices 
starting from &#163;13,600 after a &#163;5,000 Government subsidy when it goes on sale 
this spring. 
</p>
<p>
However, for now, it&#8217;s all about the impressive hot hatch Clios. Renault are 
definitely back... in fashion. 
</p>
<h4>
First Drive - New Renaultsport Clio 200 
</h4>
<p>
WHICH car firm has the most power on the Formula One grid? Would you guess 
Ferrari or Mercedes? 
</p>
<p>
Unless you&#8217;re an F1 fan, I bet you didn&#8217;t think of Renault. 
</p>
<p>
Kimi Raikkonen won the first grand prix of the year for Lotus, but it was a 
Renault engine that powered him. They also dominated the podium with 
third-placed Sebastian Vettel&#8217;s Red Bull also using French ooomph. 
</p>
<p>
Surprisingly, it&#8217;s not widely known that Renault are the power behind FOUR 
Formula One teams &#8212; that&#8217;s one third of the grid &#8212; including world champs 
Red Bull, Lotus, Caterham and Williams. Not even giants Ferrari or Merc can 
boast that. 
</p>
<p>
Ex-F1 world champ Raikkonen is actually the latest Renault advert star in 
their new Megane hatchback campaign, following in the iconic footsteps of 
Papa and Nicole and Va Va Voom. 
</p>
<p>
They chose Raikkonen because Renault just got serious, they are determined to 
make more people aware of their racing expertise, technology and 
reliability. 
</p>
<p>
The good news for us is that Renault&#8217;s F1 prowess just got affordable &#8212; from 
Formula One to one hell of a hot hatch. The 12million-selling Clio has 
undoubtedly been Renault&#8217;s heartbeat for 22 years. But the Renaultsport Clio 
is the car that gets your heart pumping. 
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;ve just had a first drive in Granada, Spain, and the good news is that not 
only is the standard Clio back with a bang, but its wilder brothers have 
extra ooh la la. 
</p>
<p>
Renault may have struggled for sales recently but they have an outstanding 
pedigree for hot hatches &#8212; selling more than 90,000 Clio Sports in 38 
countries. 
</p>
<p>
This new Clio 200 is a big departure from the current three-door 
2litre-engined model as it is only available with a five-door body, 1.6litre 
turbocharged engine and EDC six-speed dual-clutch gearbox. 
</p>
<p>
In plain English, that&#8217;s an auto not manual. It still comes in two chassis 
flavours &#8212; Sport and Cup. The latter aimed to cater for the trackday 
enthusiasts. 
</p>
<p>
While the power is the same as the outgoing 2litre, torque and grip is up. 
</p>
<p>
And, crucially, it&#8217;s lighter by 36kgs to make it more agile and give it extra 
performance, resulting in a rapid 0-62mph in 6.7 seconds and a top speed of 
143mph. Economy also jumps up by 10mpg to 44mpg, while emissions fall 46g/km 
to 144g/km. But there&#8217;s one huge difference, the Clio Sport has lost its 
hardcore edge. Renault want to widen its appeal out of the niche track-day 
enthusiast market so they can nail more sales in the ever-growing hot hatch 
sector. That&#8217;s a huge risk on a car built on its track reputation. But 
Renault will accept upsetting boy racers for more buyers. Perhaps the 
biggest surprise is ditching the fun short-throw manual gearbox of the old 
RS with the auto double-clutch. 
</p>
<p>
Renault claim the gears flick up in just 150 milliseconds but I found the 
changes too slow and frustrating even in Race mode. No manual box seems to 
have sucked all the true sporty essence out of driving and it doesn&#8217;t match 
the sharpness of VW&#8217;S equivalent DSG &#8216;box. But the best bit is that it is 
very quick. 
</p>
<p>
The power is deep and meaningful from the minute you stamp your right foot, 
meaning you can really pull out of corners with pace. 
</p>
<p>
It also sounds the business with a proper crackle and burble. You can even 
customise it to sound like other cars which is probably my favourite 
feature. It has a setting for a Renault futuristic machine with a spaceship 
noise. The Sport chassis handles with aplomb but lacks a sharp edge on 
cornering. That, again, may upset the connoisseurs but I preferred all the 
hardcore without the hard ride. 
</p>
<p>
Renault will hope the Cup version will appease the track racers. I drove this 
for a few laps round the Guadix circuit and it felt the part. It&#8217;s firmer 
than its twin brother and far more aggressive but on this very smooth 
circuit it was hard to tell how it&#8217;ll cope with our horrendous potholes.The 
Renaultsport Clio also includes enough techno gizmos to keep an F1 garage 
geek happy. It boasts an R-Link system, which can be upgraded to include the 
RS Monitor &#8212; an on-board telemetry system which has a customisable display 
of engine parameters, performance data and a GPS-activated stopwatch for lap 
times. Mind-boggling stuff. 
</p>
<p>
Not only does it perform, but it looks the dog&#8217;s danglies too. When I got 
behind the wheel of their Dezir concept two years ago, it was arguably the 
most beautiful car I&#8217;d ever driven. When Renault said the look would go into 
their next Clio, I laughed. Yet, remarkably, here it is. It&#8217;s been 
shrink-wrapped but the essence has been transformed from supercar to 
supermini and now hot hatch. 
</p>
<p>
The interior matches the exterior for drama. Renault have added splashes of 
red for passion to punctuate the moody black interior which is a remarkable 
jump upmarket from the current car.The sophisticated dash from the standard 
car also goes up a notch with a black gloss centre console housing the 7in 
touchscreen with R-Link and integrated TomTom navigation with a chrome 
surround. 
</p>
<p>
The new Renaultsport Clio is on sale now. 
</p>
<p>
Even better news is that you don&#8217;t have to earn the money of an F1 driver to 
afford it, with it costing &#163;18,995 &#8212; &#163;100 more expensive that the 
forthcoming Peugeot 208 GTi. But it is a whopping two grand more than the 
albeit less-powerful Ford Fiesta ST. 
</p>
<p>
A Renault engine topped the lot in the F1 at the weekend. It might be a bit 
softer round the edges, but on the ultra-tough hot hatch grid, this Clio is 
also back in pole position.

<![CDATA[<p>
VAUXHALL have been injecting a serious dose of styling into their cars in the 
past few years. 
</p>
<p>
It all started with the Insignia, followed by the Astra, Zafira and more 
recently the funky Adam and Mokka. 
</p>
<p>
But the Vauxhall that&#8217;s set to turn heads is the Cascada, a four-seat 
convertible that looks as toned as Jess Ennis in Lycra. 
</p>
<p>
Like Jess, the Cascada has a well-sculpted, muscular body. The only thing that 
didn&#8217;t look fresh was the predictable chrome grille that sits on all 
Vauxhalls and is beginning to look dated. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
But does the Vauxhall have the image to make a statement in the world of 
convertibles, where premium brands dominate and badge snobbery counts? 
</p>
<p>
Vauxhall point out that the Cascada is nearly &#163;8,000 less than the slightly 
smaller Audi A5 convertible, but the Audi is very big on image. 
</p>
<p>
But judge the Cascada on merit alone, whether on style, quality or engineering 
capabilities and it stands favourable comparison &#8212; and a starting price of 
&#163;23,995 is not big money for a mid-sized four-seat soft-top. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
I drove the Cascada for nearly 400 miles over two days in dry and wet 
conditions on city streets, motorways and twisting mountain roads. 
</p>
<p>
It was a relaxing, stress-free and enjoyable experience, which marked out the 
Cascada as a convertible that is a useable everyday car and a genuine 
four-seater. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Don&#8217;t think of it as a replacement for the Astra TwinTop convertible &#8212; it&#8217;s an 
altogether more classy affair and considerably bigger at 4,696mm. And don&#8217;t 
think of the Cascada as a sports car &#8212; it is very much a grand tourer 
convertible with the ability to transport four people in comfort, whatever 
the British weather throws at you. 
</p>
<p>
If the sun shines, the electric fabric roof can be down in just 17 seconds at 
speeds up to 30mph. Just as importantly, it goes up in the same time and at 
the same speed so you can avoid being soaked in a sudden shower. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
And the high-quality hood with an extra layer of polyester fleece insulation 
makes the Cascada as quiet as hard-top coupe, even at high speeds. What is 
probably most impressive about the Cascada is the quality of the interior, 
which doesn&#8217;t look out of place against top-notch German opposition. 
</p>
<p>
Even the entry-level SE model in fabric trim is well finished with 
hand-stitched leather on the dashboard, alongside instruments with the 
detail of a fine watch. 
</p>
<p>
Move up to the Elite model and you get high-quality soft leather heated seats 
front and back and all the toys and gadgets that you&#8217;d expect on any Audi or 
BMW. 
</p>
<p>
There&#8217;s everything from satnav and cruise control and a high-grade music 
entertainment system to safety equipment such as lane assist. The Cascada is 
also practical by convertible standards, with 380litres of boot space with 
the roof up and 280litres with the roof down. 
</p>
<p>
And the rear seats fold flat, allowing longer objects such as snowboards or 
surfboards for couples who enjoy sports. 
</p>
<p>
The Cascada also benefits from getting two of Vauxhall&#8217;s latest engines, 
stretching from a 1.4litre turbo petrol to a 2litre bi-turbo diesel that 
delivers 54mpg. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
I was most impressed by the new 1.6litre petrol, which delivered a nice mix of 
performance &#8212; 0-62mph in 9.2 seconds, a top speed of 135mph and just under 
40mpg. 
</p>
<p>
The crisp handling and responsive steering mean the Cascada has the agility to 
make a mountain drive good fun with the roof down and easy to drive in city 
traffic or on long motorway trips. 
</p>
<p>
There is an argument that the world doesn&#8217;t need another convertible but I 
think Vauxhall have done a brilliant job making the Cascada a genuinely 
desirable and affordable one. 
</p>
<p>
Vauxhall are looking to sell more than 2,000 a year in the UK &#8212; and with 
prices ranging from &#163;23,995 to &#163;28,605, that target should be more than 
achievable.

<![CDATA[<p>
THERE was something for everyone produced in Britain at Geneva &#8211; from the 
&#163;10,000 Nissan Note to the &#163;265,000 Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith. 
</p>
<p>
But the most spectacular British debut at the show was the &#163;886,000 McLaren 
P1, a car being billed as a &#8220;hybrid hypercar&#8221; &#8212; a green supercar. 
</p>
<p>
The fearsome and fabulous-looking P1 is the 217mph successor to the legendary 
F1 that was the world&#8217;s fastest car when launched in 1999. 
</p>
<p>
The P1 is powered by a combination of a 727bhp, 3.8litre twin turbo V8 engine 
and a 176bhp electric motor. That&#8217;s a total of 903bhp that delivers 0.62mph 
in 2.8 seconds. 
</p>
<p>
McLaren say their aim is not to be the fastest but the easiest to drive the 
faster you go. The P1 will also do 12 miles on pure electric power making it 
a supercar with zero emissions in the city. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
The aim of the Silver Wraith Coup&#233; is to provide high-performance in the 
ultimate pampered luxury. 
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s not only the most powerful Roller ever &#8212; 0-60mph in 4.4seconds &#8212; but also 
the most stylish. 
</p>
<p>
The firm have almost sold out the first year&#8217;s supply. It has also created 100 
jobs at the firm&#8217;s Goodwood HQ. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Bentley&#8217;s new Flying Spur offers 200mph supercar speed in a four-seat saloon 
that is like a mobile stately home. 
</p>
<p>
Priced at &#163;140,900, the Spur is almost a bargain by luxury limo standards. 
</p>
<p>
Britain&#8217;s hat-trick of luxury four-seat high-performance cars is joined by the 
new Aston Martin Rapide S which proves the world is going power crazy. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Aston&#8217;s four door gets a bold and deep grille that gives the front end a more 
ballsy look. 
</p>
<p>
But the big change is under the bonnet where the 6litre V12 gets a power boost 
from 470 to 550bhp, reducing 0-62mph to five seconds and taking the top 
speed to 190mph. 
</p>
<p>
At &#163;150,000, the Rapide S is an early present to celebrate Aston&#8217;s 100th 
anniversary this year. It may not be the most comfortable four seater but it 
is, by some distance, the most stylish. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
So that&#8217;s your lottery winnings spent. What about back in the real world? Easy 
&#8212; check out the new version of the Nissan Note which has gone from 
interesting mini people carrier to sharp looking supermini. 
</p>
<p>
Nissan are aiming the Note firmly at the UK&#8217;s best-selling car, the Fiesta, 
which is a tough ask but the Note is an altogether more stylish proposition 
than the model it replaces, inside and out. 
</p>
<p>
Alongside the Note was a face-lifted version of the all-electric Leaf that has 
increased its range to a maximum of 124 miles (up from 109) and the price 
has been reduced to &#163;23,000, including a Government grant of &#163;5,000. 
</p>
<p>
Both the Leaf and the Note will be built at Nissan&#8217;s Sunderland factory, 
creating hundreds of new jobs this year. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Toyota showed their Auris Sports Tourer estate car, which is further evidence 
of the firm&#8217;s promise to make models with more emotional appeal to go with 
reliability. 
</p>
<p>
It will be built alongside the Auris hatchback in Derbyshire and its extra 
practicality, with 1,658litres of space with the seats down, should see no 
shortage of family buyers. 
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s on sale now with prices from &#163;15,595 up to &#163;21,095 for the 1.8litre 
petrol hybrid. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Honda have also come up with a racy looking estate version of the 
Swindon-built Civic, that adds a new dimension to the Civic range. It will 
go on sale at the end of the year from around &#163;16,000. 
</p>
<p>
If the Jaguar F-Type and Range Rover Evoque have been seen many times before, 
they were still two of the most important cars at the show. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
The Range Rover is already off to a flying start with waiting lists in some 
countries, and the F-Type roadster has attracted huge interest around the 
world and will be one of the year&#8217;s must-have motors when it goes on sale 
next month. 
</p>
<p>
Holding its own for glamour against any of the big boys was the striking 
4-seat Vauxhall Cascada convertible at &#163;23,995.

<tol-text:story>
<![CDATA[<p>
IT looks like a spacecraft and its fuel economy is out of this world &#8212; meet 
the 313mpg car.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Volkswagen&#8217;s XL1 diesel-electric hybrid could get you from London to Leeds on 
&#163;4 of fuel.
</p>
<p>
The 800cc engine can take this aerodynamic motor from 0-62mph in 11.9 seconds 
and the top speed is 99mph.
</p>
<p>
Volkswagen has spent <b>&#163;1BILLION</b> over 15 years to make it as light 
as possible to improve fuel economy. The body is carbon fibre reinforced 
plastic and the windscreen is the world&#8217;s thinnest.
</p>
<p>
The suspension is made of lightweight aluminium and the tank holds just ten 
litres.
</p>
<p>
The two-seater XL1, which can do 30 miles on electric, weighs in at 800kg &#8212; 
400kg less than an average small family motor.
</p>
<p>
An average car of the same size does 45mpg.
</p>
<p>
It feels a bit like a cross between a sports car because you sit low, and a 
super-mini because it&#8217;s so easy to handle. VW plans to make just 250 to 
lease at &#163;500 a month &#8212; the same as renting a VW Passat.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
But Dr Ulrich Hackenberg, VW&#8217;s head of Research and Development, says the 
technology will appear in mainstream models in five years.
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
So you could be driving a 313mpg VW Golf by 2018 for a few thousand pounds 
more than its current &#163;16,000 price.

<![CDATA[<p>
LAMBORGHINI announced the release of their stunning new supercar, the Veneno, 
this week. 
</p>
<p>
With a 750 horsepower engine that can top speeds of 220mph, they claim it&#8217;s 
the fastest, most powerful supercar they&#8217;ve ever built. 
</p>
<p>
And at a cool &#163;3million, it certainly has the price tag to match. 
</p>
<p>
But how does the Veneno compare to history&#8217;s greatest monster motors? 
</p>
<p>
Here we take a look at the top ten supercars ever made to find out. 
</p>
<p>
<br></br>
</p>
<h4 align="center">
1. MacLaren F1 
</h4>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
No list of supercars would be complete without the F1. 
</p>
<p>
Starting life in 1991, the Brit-built vehicle went on to break numerous speed 
records and revolutionise car design around the world. 
</p>
<p>
Production ended in 1998 with only 106 cars ever being made. 
</p>
<p>
<br></br>
</p>
<h4 align="center">
2. Bugatti Veyron 
</h4>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
The super sport Veyron is the fastest street-legal car on the planet with a 
top speed of 267mph. 
</p>
<p>
It features a massive 8-litre turbo engine that kicks out a frankly ridiculous 
987 brake horsepower. 
</p>
<p>
It was also recognised by Sun columnist Jeremy Clarkson as the car of the 
decade for 2000-2009 on Top Gear. 
</p>
<p>
<br></br>
</p>
<h4 align="center">
3. Ferrari F40 
</h4>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
When the F40 was released in 1987, it was the fastest and most powerful car 
Ferrari sold. 
</p>
<p>
It was also the most expensive &#8212; some buyers are reported to have paid an 
eye-watering $1.6MILLION to get their hands on one. 
</p>
<p>
It is still recognised as one of the best supercars around to this day. 
</p>
<p>
<br></br>
</p>
<h4 align="center">
4. Aston Martin DB5 
</h4>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
The DB5 is technically a grand tourer, rather than a supercar, but James 
Bond&#8217;s most famous motor is so iconic it was impossible to leave it out. 
</p>
<p>
The real thing doesn&#8217;t have machine guns or ejector seats, but it is still 
recognised as one of the most beautiful vehicles ever made. 
</p>
<p>
<br></br>
</p>
<h4 align="center">
5. Lamborghini Countach 
</h4>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
The countach was a pioneer in more ways than one. 
</p>
<p>
It was the first to make the aerodynamic &#8220;wedge-shaped&#8221; design popular and it 
was also the first supercar to move the driver&#8217;s cabin forward, leaving more 
space in the back for its phenomenal engine. 
</p>
<p>
Experts regularly cite the Countach as a real breakthrough in supercar design. 
</p>
<p>
<br></br>
</p>
<h4 align="center">
6. Dusenberg model SSJ 
</h4>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Compared to today&#8217;s mega-powerful motors, the Dusenberg&#8217;s paltry 350 
horsepower might not sound like much. 
</p>
<p>
But when you consider the model SSJ was hitting those heights in the 1930s, 
the picture starts to look at bit different. 
</p>
<p>
This car was way ahead of its time, managing to achieve a top speed of over 
135mph in 1935. 
</p>
<p>
One of them sold at auction in 2004 for $4.4MILLION &#8212; making it one of the 
world&#8217;s most expensive cars. 
</p>
<p>
<br></br>
</p>
<h4 align="center">
7. Ford GT40 
</h4>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
This iconic racer took the world by storm when it won the &#8220;24 Hours of Le 
Mans&#8221; race four consecutive times in the 1960s. 
</p>
<p>
Since then it has been admired by petrol-heads the world over. 
</p>
<p>
The GT40 was also used as the inspiration for the Ford GT, released in 2005. 
</p>
<p>
<br></br>
</p>
<h4 align="center">
8. Pagani Zonda 
</h4>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Famous for being a millionaire&#8217;s plaything, the Zonda is adored by Top Gear 
presenter Richard Hammond. 
</p>
<p>
It can hit speeds of over 230mph and debuted in 1999. 
</p>
<p>
<br></br>
</p>
<h4 align="center">
9. Porsche 911 
</h4>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Perhaps more well known for its iconic shape than for stats and specs, the 911 
is still one of the greatest cars ever made. 
</p>
<p>
Porsche have released various incarnations of the model over the years, one of 
which &#8212; the 935 turbo &#8212; won 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979. 
</p>
<p>
<br></br>
</p>
<h4 align="center">
10. Shelby Cobra 
</h4>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
One of these amazing 800-horsepower beasts made history in 2007 when it sold 
at auction for $5.5million. 
</p>
<p>
Known as the &#8220;super snake&#8221; the car was built in 1966 and is as beautiful as it 
is expensive. 
</p>
<p>
<br></br>
</p>
<p>
<b>Verdict:</b> While the new Lambo may have some impressive stats, these 
classic supercars have been tried and tested for years - they have earned 
their place at the top. 
</p>
<p>
It's going to take some time before we really know if the Veneno can put its 
mouth where its money is.

<tol-text:story>
<![CDATA[<p>
SAN Francisco sunshine, the world&#8217;s fastest four-seat convertible and a 1,000 
mile drive... perfect. 
</p>
<p>
Especially when you&#8217;ve just left England in the grip of an icy Arctic freeze. 
</p>
<p>
And my trip in the Bentley Continental GT Speed turned into a dream drive from 
San Francisco to Las Vegas in two glorious days of high-speed driving &#8212; roof 
down the whole way. 
</p>
<p>
America is actually the ideal location for a Bentley &#8212; and not just because of 
the weather. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s the biggest sales market for the luxury brand and the GT convertible. 
</p>
<p>
Mind you, Bentley are currently enjoying sales success across the world, as 
the British firm have once again established themselves as one of the 
favourite brands for the rich and famous. 
</p>
<p>
And when you see the GT Speed convertible glistening in the early-morning 
sunshine, it&#8217;s easy to see why. 
</p>
<p>
There may be more exotic convertibles than the Bentley but none can match its 
aristocratic grandeur. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
It&#8217;s the perfect mix of high-speed performance and unashamed luxury &#8212; a mobile 
testament to British craftsmanship at its very best. 
</p>
<p>
It has to be the classiest way to get a sun tan &#8212; albeit a seriously expensive 
one as it carries a price tag of &#163;167,900. 
</p>
<p>
The GT Speed also happens to be the fastest way to experience wind-in-the-hair 
motoring for four people, living up to its name with a top marker of 202mph. 
</p>
<p>
Floor the accelerator pedal and you are propelled forward in a wave of power. 
Forget about 0-60mph times &#8212; the GT Speed hits 100mph in just 9.7 seconds 
and continues relentlessly until you join the 200mph club. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
It should feel like a violent punch in the back but this is a Bentley and it 
does all the hard work in a ridiculously smooth and serene manner. 
</p>
<p>
Clearly they are excessive speeds that will lose you your licence and the 
reality is you won&#8217;t drive anywhere near the top speed in the UK. 
</p>
<p>
But knowing the Bentley can do it is part of what makes it so special. What 
you will do constantly is flatten the accelerator pedal just so you can hear 
the velvety sound of the 6litre W12 cylinder engine. 
</p>
<p>
In full cry, it is a motoring masterpiece &#8212; a deep rumble that erupts like a 
volcano. 
</p>
<p>
There are other elements that take the driving experience to an added 
dimension of pure pleasure. 
</p>
<p>
Things such as the brilliant eight-speed auto gearbox, which can switch to 
manual mode via F1-style paddles on the steering column or a beautifully 
crafted aluminium gearlever. The way the Bentley handles at speed is also 
truly remarkable, even more so when you think how big it is. 
</p>
<p>
The grip at times seems to defy the laws of physics and it&#8217;s capable of doing 
it in any conditions &#8212; as I experienced in the snow-capped mountains of 
Nevada &#8212; because the GT Speed is equipped with all-wheel drive. 
</p>
<p>
Lowered and self-levelling sports suspension that adapts instantly to the road 
also gives the GT a magic carpet ride at speeds which would see most cars 
careering off the road. 
</p>
<p>
I could happily spend the rest of my driving days sitting in the glorious 
luxury of the Bentley, because this is British craftsmanship in wood and 
leather that no one can equal. 
</p>
<p>
You can see, touch and feel the hours of painstaking expertise that have gone 
into crafting the Bentley cabin &#8212; the intricate hand-stitching of the 
leather work and wood that has been lovingly shaped like sculpted furniture. 
</p>
<p>
And it&#8217;s the wonderful extras, such as the neck warmer fitted into the heated 
seats, that allow you to drive roof-down all year round. (The leather 
quilted seats can also massage you and be cooled in summer.) 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Should you tire of the engine sound, there is a music and entertainment system 
that&#8217;s like having front-row seats at the Royal Albert Hall. 
</p>
<p>
I also love the understated elegance of the GT Speed &#8212; the sculpted bodywork 
that ripples like the finely tuned muscles of an athlete. 
</p>
<p>
The classic Bentley grille is finished in a subtle dark tint, while the twin 
LED headlights sparkle like jewellery and the 21in alloys look like a modern 
chariot&#8217;s wheels. 
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s all nicely finished off by an XL-sized double exhaust and a rear diffuser 
that, like the rest of the GT Speed, hints at something extra special. 
</p>
<p>
Which is exactly what it is &#8212; a showpiece of British craftsmanship and 
engineering excellence for lucky owners with the need for speed.

<tol-text:story>
<![CDATA[<p>
AS a working musician and a farmer, rock star Alex James definitely needs a 
reliable and versatile vehicle. 
</p>
<p>
Along with his cheesemaking and music projects, the Blur bassist has five kids 
to get from A to B. 
</p>
<p>
So when he was asked to test drive Korean brand SsangYong&#8217;s new Korando 4x4, 
he jumped right in. 
</p>
<p>
He said: &#8220;We&#8217;re a big family and when it snows it can be difficult to get cars 
up the farm track. There have been times when we&#8217;ve been stranded. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;As a parent I&#8217;m less and less concerned about playing car &#8216;top trumps&#8217; and 
more interested in things like safety. SsangYong are so confident about 
their product that they offer a five-year unlimited mileage warranty. 
</p>
<p>
"That&#8217;s impressive.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Alex trialled the Korando on trips to the supermarket and on the school run 
and he even chased a few sheep. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It&#8217;s quite a good sheepdog substitute,&#8221; he joked. He was impressed by the 
vehicle&#8217;s sleek lines, designed by Italian stylist 
</p>
<p>
Giugiaro, and by its Korean lineage. 
</p>
<p>
Alex said: &#8220;The Korando is versatile on the school run or on the M40, even the 
farm tracks. It&#8217;s got a snazzy thing going on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The Italian styling might have made an impact on Alex, but for his children it 
was the fact SsangYong are based in the Seoul district of Gangnam &#8211; made 
famous by hit rapper Psy &#8211; that clinched it. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;When I told the kids that, they wanted to go everywhere Gangnam Style,&#8221; 
laughed Alex. 
</p>
<p>
Luckily, going anywhere is a cinch in the five-seater Korando and the 2-litre 
engine with turbo diesel power plus will tow any trailer up to 2 metric 
tonnes. The spacious boot was just right for carting Socks the family 
whippet around too. 
</p>
<p>
Alex said: &#8220;He&#8217;s very comfortable back there.&#8221; 
</p>

<tol-text:story>
<![CDATA[<p>
IT&#8217;S still not exactly cool to buy a Skoda &#8211; but it&#8217;s becoming an increasingly 
smart move to own one.
</p>
<p>
Skoda are celebrating producing 15million cars, with five million built in the 
last six years. 
</p>
<p>
And in 2012 they had yet another record car sales year, shifting almost a 
MILLION &#8211; a massive transformation from the early 1990s when they sold 
172,000 Favorits a year.
</p>
<p>
Like in the rest of Europe, UK drivers are now big fans of Skoda and the 
reason is simple &#8211; you get an awful lot of car for your money. 
</p>
<p>
Their 15millionth car is impressive but the real story is that one third of 
those vehicles have been made in the past six years.
</p>
<p>
Skoda have deservedly become one of the major motoring success stories of the 
last decade &#8212; almost a rags-to-riches story.
</p>
<p>
If Skoda were not quite in rags when the Volkswagen Group took control in 
1991, they were one of the car world&#8217;s poor relations.
</p>
<p>
Obviously the VW Group have played a key part in the firm&#8217;s transformation, 
having invested millions in new models and facilities and sharing 
state-of-the-art technology.
</p>
<p>
But Skoda are still run from their homeland in the Czech Republic, with highly 
skilled workers continuing a car-making tradition that spans 118 years.
</p>
<p>
That makes Skoda one of the oldest car manufacturers in the world.
</p>
<p>
Proud Company chairman Dr Winfried Vahland explained: &#8220;The Skoda team is very 
proud of reaching 15 million cars &#8212; it is a symbol of the great development 
of the brand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
And it was very fitting that the 15th millionth model produced was a new 
Octavia &#8212; the model that has been the heartbeat of the firm&#8217;s turnaround 
with 3.75million sales since 1996, including 210,000 in the UK.
</p>
<p>
<i>Below we have tested two of the new versions.</i>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>
ROAD TEST: SKODA OCTAVIA
</h4>
<p>
<b>THE new Octavia was proving a seriously impressive car... until it refused 
to start.</b>
</p>
<p>
The failure was a major shock for a car noted for its reliability, and an 
embarrassment &#8212; because it happened when I was giving some friends a lift to 
a funeral!
</p>
<p>
The excellent man from the AA who quickly got me moving said there was an 
electrical glitch that had drained the battery.
</p>
<p>
He also said that such faults occasionally happened on just about every car 
because of the huge amount of technology in modern vehicles.
</p>
<p>
So I&#8217;m happy to give the Octavia the benefit of the doubt and put it down to a 
rare gremlin, because the car and a second model were excellent &#8212; and I&#8217;ve 
never had a problem with a Skoda in over 20 years of testing.
</p>
<p>
The latest Octavia is quite simply better than the model it replaces in every 
way.
</p>
<p>
Quality It&#8217;s bigger, better quality and although it competes against 
hatchbacks in price, it&#8217;s the size of a big family car.
</p>
<p>
Although it shares its body platform with the latest VW Golf, it has an 
extended wheelbase that makes it 90mm longer and 45mm wider.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
This means it&#8217;s got executive car interior space for four or five tall adults, 
and the boot is huge.
</p>
<p>
At 590 litres, it&#8217;s bigger than a Mondeo&#8217;s, and increases to 1,580 litres with 
the rear seats down. That&#8217;s big estate territory.
</p>
<p>
And driver and passengers travel not only in comfort but also in style, with 
quality soft-touch plastics and trim and plush leather in the 
top-of-the-range models.
</p>
<p>
Even the entry-level model gets air con, a DAB radio and Bluetooth 
connectivity, electric front windows, heated door mirrors, central locking 
and an outside temperature gauge. You can add sat-nav for &#163;550.
</p>
<p>
Stepping up to the SE trim adds rear parking sensors, dual zone climate 
control and alloys, while the range-topping Elegance gets sat-nav, leather 
upholstery and cruise control.
</p>
<p>
The Octavia is now an imposing looking car with a strong, elegant profile that 
gives it an upmarket appearance.
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s the same story on the inside where everything from the smart instrument 
dials and trim make this a Skoda with a VW Passat feel about it.
</p>
<p>
And as the Octavia shares the full VW line-up of top notch petrol and diesel 
engines, the driving package is top drawer as well.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
The old entry level 1.4 has been replaced by an excellent 1.2litre TSi petrol, 
used by Audi.
</p>
<p>
This is a gem, more than capable of pulling the extra bulk of the Octavia in a 
smooth and refined way, plus nearly 50mpg.
</p>
<p>
But if you want more power, there are other petrol options on the TSi, up to 
2litres, that deliver between 37 and 44mpg.
</p>
<p>
And if economy is your aim, the 1.6 and 2litre diesels are good for between 58 
and 62mpg.
</p>
<p>
Handling and ride are also good which means as an all-round package, the 
Octavia is hard to beat.
</p>
<p>
Though it&#8217;s about &#163;2,000 more than the model it replaces, the reality is the 
Octavia has been superseded by the new Rapid model and is now competing with 
models in the class above.
</p>
<p>
Which means that the starting price of &#163;15,990 for the entry 1.2litre TSi is a 
real bargain for a car that offers so much.
</p>
<p>
And at &#163;23,240 even the top-of- the-range 2litre turbo diesel Octavia in full 
leather makes plenty of sense.
</p>
<p>
Compare that to &#163;7,500 for the cheap, nasty and considerably smaller Favorit 
in 1991 and today&#8217;s Skodas look every inch a bargain.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
- THE Octavia hatchback and saloon models will be joined by an estate version 
in June &#8212; which will be making its first appearance at Geneva next month.
</p>
<p>
Prices are expected to start around &#163;17,000 &#8212; here&#8217;s a sneak first pic of it.

But the big news is that they are ready to launch a Q2, Q4 and Q6 over the 
next few years as they believe that will help them topple BMW as the world&#8217;s 
top prestige sellers.
</p>
<p>
Audi only moved into SUVs in 2005 with the Q7 and subsequently added the Q5 
and Q3.
</p>
<p>
The SUV market is one of the fast-growing sectors in the world and is expected 
to expand from 2.2million sales last year to 3million within the next five 
years.
</p>
<p>
After increasing sales 12 per cent to 1.46million cars last year, Audi&#8217;s 
performance is also driving parent firm Volkswagen&#8217;s equally ruthless bid to 
become the world&#8217;s No1-selling car firm by 2018.
</p>
<p>
The Q3 RS is the fourth performance division model that Audi will launch this 
year alongside the RS6 Avant, RS5 Cabriolet and RS7.
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s powered by a 2.5litre turbocharged petrol engine and can hit 62mph in 
just 5.5 seconds and hit an electronically limited top speed of 155mph. The 
Q3 RS is expected to cost a whopping &#163;11,000 more than the current Q3 2litre 
at around &#163;42,000.
</p>
<p>
But, with those sort of performance figures, that&#8217;s an SUV that belongs on the 
Nurburgring.
</p>
<p>
And we did just that with Audi&#8217;s mouthwatering new RS4 Avant.
</p>
<p>
We drove this great estate to Germany and also this week had a first drive in 
Scotland. For this generation, the RS4 is only available as an Avant &#8212; Audi 
say buyers of the old saloon and cabrio versions have switched to the RS5.
</p>
<p>
We reckon that&#8217;s a good thing &#8212; the Avant body boasts 1,430 litres of space 
and it looks breathtaking in RS spec. There are big air intakes in the 
aggressive front bumper, bulging squared-off wheelarches, 19in alloys and a 
rear end that features huge chrome exhausts and a roof spoiler.
</p>
<p>
<i>Engineers have also dropped the ride height by 20mm and fitted uprated 
brakes. You can also add ceramic brakes and the &#163;2,250 Sport Package, which 
includes Dynamic Ride Control adaptive dampers, dynamic steering, 20in 
alloys and a sports exhaust.</i>
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s got amazing kit and it also goes like s***. Up front is an RS5-derived 
444bhp 4.2litre V8, which drives all four wheels through a seven-speed 
twin-clutch S tronic gearbox.
</p>
<p>
The RS4 Avant is incredibly fast. With launch control system, it sprints from 
0-62mph in just 4.7 seconds &#8212; just a tenth down on its closest rival, the 
451bhp Mercedes C63 AMG Estate. The 4.2litre engine is phenomenal in its 
response. It really is supercar fast, while the noise it makes is incredible 
&#8212; a sensational V8 rumble, which is punctuated by pops and bangs from the 
exhaust when you lift off.
</p>
<p>
But the RS4&#8217;s real attraction is the traction.
</p>
<p>
Even on our icy and greasy potholed roads, the benefit of the quattro 
four-wheel-drive system and the clever electronic aids make sure all the 
power is distributed to whatever tyres have the most grip and all the power 
is translated into forward acceleration.
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s also quite comfortable. Audis can be hard-riding, but once in Comfort 
suspension mode, this RS4 delivers all the breathtaking without being 
back-breaking.
</p>
<p>
There&#8217;s no shortage of standard equipment, either. You get sports seats and a 
DVD sat-nav.
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s not cheap at &#163;54,925. But remember this is a car that&#8217;s good for racing 
at the &#8216;Ring just as well as the rubbish dump.
</p>
<p>
This is another Audi winner. They&#8217;re going all out to kick their rivals up the 
RS.

<tol-text:story>
<![CDATA[<p>
IT&#8217;S Scotland&#8217;s perfect mix of ice cream and ice cool. 
</p>
<p>
This is the sensational <a href="http://www.ferrari.com/english/Pages/home.aspx" target="_blank">Ferrari</a> 
FF &#8212; the four-wheel-drive supercar that can still deliver all the go, go, go 
even in the snow. 
</p>
<p>
For once Scotland&#8217;s weather didn&#8217;t let us down, serving up a blanket of the 
cold white stuff to help prove what this FF can really do. 
</p>
<p>
Bizarrely, the snow had melted on the way down to Ferrari&#8217;s Scottish &#8216;Little 
Italy&#8217; spiritual home in Largs, Ayrshire. 
</p>
<p>
This is where the world&#8217;s most famous and powerful brand meets the home of 
Scotland&#8217;s most famous cafe and ice cream parlour, Nardinis, and restaurant, 
Tony Macaroni. 
</p>
<p>
The Nardini family arrived in Scotland in 1890 but this caf&#233; opened in 1935 &#8212; 
the same year Enzo Ferrari and engineer Luigi Bazzi developed the Alfa Romeo 
Bimotore racing car. 
</p>
<p>
It was the first ever car to carry the now famous prancing horse Scuderia 
Ferrari on its flanks &#8212; and has been dubbed the first ever Ferrari. 
</p>
<p>
And ever since 1935, this seafront corner has oozed more Azzurri than 
Ayrshire. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Largs is also the home of Colin and Chris Weir, the UK&#8217;s biggest-ever lottery 
winners of &#163;161million back in July 2011. 
</p>
<p>
Indeed, you&#8217;ll need to hit the lotto jackpot to afford this FF at &#163;227,000. 
</p>
<p>
But this is something very special. It could be phew. 
</p>
<p>
On paper it just doesn&#8217;t sound right &#8212; a four-seat Ferrari 4x4. 
</p>
<p>
But the world&#8217;s favourite supercar firm turned the motoring world upside down 
with this shock merchant. 
</p>
<p>
Driving the Ferrari is a breathtaking and unforgettable experience, whether 
you are on snow or Tarmac. 
</p>
<p>
This is the Ferrari for all seasons. The highly talented engineers have 
clearly relished the challenge of developing an all-wheel-drive system, in 
the same way they enjoy bringing the technology of the racetrack to their 
road-going supercars. 
</p>
<p>
<i>How the system works is a seriously complex affair &#8212; you need to be Stephen 
Hawking to understand it.</i>
</p>
<p>
All you really need to know is that it works brilliantly and gives the FF 
phenomenal grip in all conditions. 
</p>
<p>
Unlike the permanent heavyweight all-wheel-drive systems on the average 4x4, 
the sophisticated Ferrari package is half the weight and only operates grip 
on all four wheels when it is necessary. But, being a Ferrari, having a 
hi-tech 4x4 system would be irrelevant if the FF couldn&#8217;t also perform with 
the firm&#8217;s legendary handling and performance. 
</p>
<p>
<i>The latest version of the 6.3litre V12 engine hits 0-62mph in just 3.7 
seconds, 0-125mph in 11 seconds and a top speed of 208mph. That guarantees 
it instant access to the supercar elite.</i>
</p>
<p>
Even the fuel economy is a reasonable 19mpg and CO2 is down to 360g/km. 
</p>
<p>
Climbing into the cockpit feels like being planted into the soul of supercars. 
</p>
<p>
You are greeted by a steering wheel that looks more PlayStation than Prancing 
Horse. All the controls are on this wheel. 
</p>
<p>
One firm press on the most important &#8216;Start&#8217; button and there is a brief 
delay. 
</p>
<p>
Then all hell breaks loose. The ignition kicks in with a ripping crackle that 
goes up through your feet, spleen, spine and into your eardrums and dreams. 
It&#8217;s pure horsepower with a huge dash of Hollywood. 
</p>
<p>
The steering is ultra-responsive and pin sharp, while the F1-style paddles 
deliver razor-sharp gear changes from the seven-speed gearbox. 
</p>
<p>
There is also the Manettino control panel, which has settings for comfort, 
sport, wet, ice/snow and an electronic stability control. This means you can 
dial in the setting to suit the conditions &#8212; or your mood. 
</p>
<p>
There is even a launch control button for instant lift-off. 
</p>
<p>
But the FF&#8217;s final trick is to allow four people to enjoy the amazing Ferrari 
experience and in a degree of comfort. In the back, I had good leg and head 
room and even my 6ft 3in nephew fitted in snugly. 
</p>
<p>
The luggage space is also remarkable for a supercar &#8212; 450litres. That is 
enough for golf bags and luggage cases. 
</p>
<p>
With the rear seats folded flat, it increases to 800litres. That is close to 
estate-car levels of versatility. 
</p>
<p>
All this is packaged in first-class levels of luxury, from the figure-hugging 
soft leather seats to the extensive executive equipment like satnav and 
entertainment system with rear-seat DVD players. 
</p>
<p>
Despite a price tag of &#163;227,000, the FF has been a big sell-out &#8212; and 
exclusivity guaranteed with less than 50 coming to the UK. 
</p>
<p>
In this meeting of Nardinis ice cream of North Ayrshire and sheer power, these 
legendary Italians certainly know how to serve up something ultra cool &#8212; 
whether FF stands for four-wheel-drive or fast food. 
</p>
<p>
One thing is for sure, though, this Ferrari is simply phenomenal with a 
capital FF.

<tol-text:story>
<![CDATA[<p>
BUILDER and TV star Tommy Walsh wants a vehicle that&#8217;s tough and hard working 
but stylish too. 
</p>
<p>
That&#8217;s why he was delighted to test drive the SsangYong Korando Sports 4x4 
pick-up. 
</p>
<p>
As a busy dad-of-three, juggling his building firm in east London with work as 
a writer and telly presenter, Tommy is after a motor that delivers on 
several fronts. 
</p>
<p>
Which is why he loved the versatility of the Korean brand&#8217;s 4x4 pick-up. 
</p>
<p>
Tommy, 56, said: &#8220;For a builder or a tradesman, a utility vehicle has to do 
what it says on the tin and the Korando Sports does. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But the bonus is it&#8217;s also nice-looking and comfortable. You can more or less 
get any tools you need into the back. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The tailgate is strong and heavy so you can use it as an extension if you&#8217;ve 
got a longer load. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And if you need height, the weather-proof canopy comes off the rear loading 
bay. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But the top is good for security and that&#8217;s important as most tradesmen carry 
a lot of valuable kit these days. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The Korando Sports doubles up great as a domestic vehicle. It looks good and 
the leather interior is stylish and easy to wipe clean. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;But the real winner was the heated seats. My wife Marie loved them and so did 
my 19-year-old son Jonjo after football training. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And for a builder, full of aches and pains after a tough day, it&#8217;s like 
having a hot massage as you drive home. What a clever thing to put into a 
working vehicle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The Sports is a powerful beast, too, with a braked-trailer limit of 2.3 metric 
tonnes. 
</p>
<p>
Tommy said: &#8220;It feels like a big car, secure and robust, but it&#8217;s nifty and 
has a good turn of speed and the engine is surprisingly quiet. 
</p>
<p>
"There&#8217;s good vision all round and it&#8217;s fitted with parking sensors, 
which is great for a big vehicle. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The cabin is spacious too &#8212; I&#8217;m a big bloke and I found it very comfortable.
</p>
<p>
&#8220;I particularly thought the Bluetooth for your phone was a bonus. Hands-free 
is so important for a tradesman as your livelihood can depend on being able 
to take calls while you&#8217;re on the move. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And you certainly get a lot of bang for your buck. I&#8217;ve only used a quarter 
of a tank of diesel and I&#8217;ve been all over in it for five days. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The three key things a tradesman looks for are: Is it right for the job? What 
is the price? And what is the mpg? 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The Korando Sports scores on all those points &#8212; it&#8217;s perfect for what it was 
designed for. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And the five-year unlimited mileage warranty is absolutely brilliant &#8212; a 
really reassuring extra.&#8221;
</p>
<p>

<![CDATA[<p>
THE stakes couldn&#8217;t be any higher for one single car... 
</p>
<p>
If Jaguar are to regain their status as one of the world&#8217;s great car brands, 
the new F-Type has to be a 100 per cent sales success. 
</p>
<p>
Failure is not an option and the F-Type can&#8217;t simply be very good. It needs to 
be outstanding &#8211; thousands of British jobs are riding on it. 
</p>
<p>
The car also carries the considerable burden of being the long-awaited 
successor to the legendary E-Type. Jaguar need the F-Type to have the same 
magic as its predecessor and the same halo effect on the image of the brand. 
</p>
<p>
This week in Dubai, after years of waiting, I finally got the first insight 
into just how good the F-Type is, and whether or not it lives up to the hype 
surrounding it. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4 align="center">
Just my F-Type 
</h4>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>THE F-Type is the start of Jaguar&#8217;s new model revolution which aims to more 
than double sales.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Jaguar bosses know the firm needs another TWO big-selling new models 
alongside the F-Type to end years of under-achieving and give them a future. </b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Even if it is a sales success, the F-Type will only hit figures of around 
15,000 a year because sports cars are a niche market in today&#8217;s world. </b>
</p>
<p>
<b>The two new models which will be vital to Jaguar will be a small executive 
car due in 2015 and a radical new SUV that will follow in 2015/16. </b>
</p>
<p>
<b>They will stretch the range, alongside the F-Type, XF and XJ to a five 
model line-up, good enough to take on Porsche. </b>
</p>
<p>
<b>But the F-Type is the catalyst to re-igniting Jaguar, a halo car to once 
again make the firm desirable. </b>
</p>
<p>
<b>This week, Motoring Editor KEN GIBSON found out if it&#8217;s good enough to 
carry that burden.</b>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
AS the Dubai sun rises on the Jaguar F-Type, it looks every inch the car to 
launch a new era for the firm. 
</p>
<p>
After decades of living in the shadows of its famous past, the F-Type is the 
car that will decide Jaguar&#8217;s long term future. 
</p>
<p>
Recent models like the XK Coup&#233;, the XF and XJ saloons have all been very good 
cars but they have lacked the motoring X factor to make them irresistible. 
</p>
<p>
The F-Type has that X factor, just like the 1960s E-Type &#8212; the last Jaguar to 
capture the imagination and shock the motoring world. 
</p>
<p>
It looks sensational from every angle. Designer Ian Callum and his team have 
done an outstanding job on delivering a sports car that is truly desirable. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
It has dramatic but simple lines, an aggressive imposing face and the fabulous 
rear end that looks like a &#163;100,000-plus supercar. 
</p>
<p>
And it looks like a car that demands to be driven, and driven very fast. Which 
is exactly what we did on the long, open roads of the desert outside Dubai, 
the perfect setting to put a sports car through its paces. 
</p>
<p>
I&#8217;d been given the chance to ride shotgun as the F-Type underwent final 
testing before hitting UK showrooms in April. 
</p>
<p>
Although I was totally frustrated at not being in the driver&#8217;s seat, I settled 
for the chance to find out how good the car really is. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
And the first thing I can tell you is when you press the starter button, it 
sounds like a proper sports car. 
</p>
<p>
Vehicles like this have to sound special, they have to make the hairs on the 
back of your head stand up and fill you with expectation. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
And both the 3litre V6 and the 5litre V8 engines that power the F-Type make a 
deep riotous roar of intent that builds up to a crescendo of noise that 
leaves a glorious buzzing in your ears. 
</p>
<p>
They both have their own distinct sound. The V8 is deeper, throatier, like a 
gun firing. It is more intimidating But the V6 has its own sweet symphony 
that will be music to the ears of any sports car aficionado. 
</p>
<p>
So the F-Type looks and sounds the part. But does it deliver a drive to go 
with it? Jaguar&#8217;s chassis guru Mike Cross says the priority was for the car 
to be fun to drive. 
</p>
<p>
It takes only a few miles on the open desert roads to answer the question. 
</p>
<p>
The F-Type comes alive when you flatten the accelerator and it feels every 
inch a pure sports car. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
It hugs the road like a second skin and the faster you go, the happier it 
becomes. This is a Jaguar built for speed. 
</p>
<p>
And both the V6 and V8 supercharged engines deliver serious speed. Even the 
entry-level V6 has 340bhp, which propels it from 0-60mph in 5.1 seconds to a 
top speed of 161mph. 
</p>
<p>
But it&#8217;s the 595bhp V8 that really blows you away. 
</p>
<p>
I was literally thrown back into the seat when full power was unleashed. It 
takes just 4.2 glorious seconds from 0-60mph and the top speed goes up to 
186mph. 
</p>
<p>
As my driver, senior endurance test engineer John Winchester, floored the V8, 
it was obvious even from the passenger seat that this is a Jaguar capable of 
locking horns with not just a Porsche Boxster, but the 911. 
</p>
<p>
<i>And after a day on board, it was also obvious that the F-Type is the real 
deal, a pure two-seat sports car worthy of following in the tyre tracks of 
the E-Type.</i>
</p>
<h4 align="center">
F is for the future 
</h4>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>THE F-Type is far more than a sports car &#8211; there are thousands of British 
jobs riding on its success.</b>
</p>
<p>
For workers such as 21-year-old Thomas O&#8217;Sullivan, the car is the passport to 
job security for him and his family. 
</p>
<p>
He has been at Jaguar&#8217;s Castle Bromwich factory for only four months, after 
previously facing an uncertain future on building sites. 
</p>
<p>
Now Thomas feels he has a long-term future with prospects to develop a career. 
</p>
<p>
He said: &#8220;There are real opportunities at Jaguar for a young person. I&#8217;m 
really enjoying coming to work and it&#8217;s great for me and my family to have a 
stable future for the first time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Working with him on the production lines is Mark Baker. 
</p>
<p>
At 57, he is at the opposite end of the scale with more than 35 years&#8217; 
experience at the company. But like Thomas, he believes that the future is 
now bright for Jaguar. 
</p>
<p>
Mark said: &#8220;It&#8217;s the most confident I have ever felt about the future. The 
firm is on the way up with new models like the F-Type.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
It has been a rollercoaster ride working for Jag over the years. 
</p>
<p>
Mark added: &#8220;When I started there were 13,000 people working at Castle 
Bromwich. A few years ago that was down to 1,000 and the plant was facing 
closure. But Jag have backed the plant and I&#8217;m looking forward to finishing 
my career here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Future Phil Livingstone, 61, is a veteran of 39 years at Castle Bromwich &#8212; and 
he also sees a positive future for the firm. 
</p>
<p>
He said: &#8220;My job has been threatened a few times over the years. But you can 
see a real future now with the new models and the money they are investing 
here &#8212; and the F-Type is like sex on wheels.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Another worker whose life is being transformed by Jaguar is 29-year-old sheet 
metal worker Steve Richings. 
</p>
<p>
He experienced the harsh side of the industry when he lost his job with the 
closure of Peugeot&#8217;s UK factory. 
</p>
<p>
Steve said: &#8220;That was a hammer blow but I always wanted to get back in to the 
industry. Getting a job with Jaguar is a great opportunity because everyone 
is very confident about the future.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
The workers are the human face of why the F-Type needs to succeed for Jaguar. 
</p>
<p>
They are part of 3,000 workers &#8212; including 1,100 new recruits &#8212; taken on by 
Jaguar at Castle Bromwich to build the F-Type alongside the XF, XJ and XK 
models. 
</p>
<p>
The turnaround is nothing short of remarkable. 
</p>
<p>
Just a few years ago, in the middle of the double-dip recession, owners Tata 
were close to shutting the plant. 
</p>
<p>
But in the end they kept faith with the factory and its workers. 
</p>
<p>
They invested multi-millions turning it into a high-tech, highly efficient 
plant about to deliver the most exciting line-up of cars in Jag&#8217;s history.

THE word Ssangyong is Korean for twin dragons and you are sure to be fired up 
&#8212; as The Sun have teamed up with the manufacturer for your chance to win a 
SsangYong Korando 4x4. 
</p>
<p>
The SsangYong Korando has bags of style &#8212; Gangnam Style &#8212; as it is made in the 
same city as Psy&#8217;s dance sensation record. <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/advertisement_feature/feature05/article4813496.ece?">Former 
Blur bassist Alex James soon found out what that meant on his test drive.</a> </p>
<p>
He said: &#8220;When I told the kids that, they wanted to go everywhere Gangnam 
Style. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The Korando is versatile on the school run or on the M40, even the farm 
tracks. It&#8217;s got a snazzy thing going on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Whilst the Italian-styled Korean 4x4 wowed the musician, it also caught the 
experienced eye of the Sun&#8217;s motoring editor Ken Gibson. 
</p>
<p>
Having driven hundreds of 4x4s over the years, Ken says: &#8220;You can park the 
Korando alongside SUVs costing twice as much and it more than holds its own. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;It&#8217;s one of the most affordable, genuine and well-equipped 4x4s in the 
compact SUV sector." 
</p>
<p>
Now you could be in the driving seat of this fantastic family car worth 
&#163;19,295. 
</p>
<p>
Just answer three simple questions, below, (tip: <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/advertisement_feature/feature05/article4813496.ece?">Reading 
Alex James' test drive experience will help you out</a>) and you&#8217;ll be in 
the hat. 
</p>

Korando, <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/advertisement_feature/feature05/4791118/Korando-4x4-is-the-perfect-family-car-says-Melinda.html">check

<![CDATA[<p>
FORMER Page 3 girl Melinda Messenger has the perfect assets to test-drive the 
new SsangYong Korando 4x4. 
</p>
<p>
With three young children and a busy career as a TV presenter, she needs a 
vehicle that delivers value, practicality, style and reliability. 
</p>
<p>
These days, Melinda is a consumer champion looking out for the best deal 
around. 
</p>
<p>
Her latest job is working on Cowboy Builders and Cowboy Traders, fighting 
battles for the public. 
</p>
<p>
What&#8217;s more, before she became a model Melinda was a customer services 
manager, where she gained hands-on experience of what people really want. 
</p>
<p>
So when she was asked to put one of Korean brand SsangYong&#8217;s latest model 
through its paces, she left no stone unturned. 
</p>
<p>
SsangYong's aim is to provide great value motors that are different to the 
boxy bargain brands of the past. 
</p>
<p>
The sleek lines of the Korando, designed by the Italian stylist Giugiaro, 
deliver style too. 
</p>
<p>
But the Korando has more than just looks. There&#8217;s the five-year unlimited 
mileage warranty offering great peace of mind and the Korando&#8217;s powerful 
2-litre engine gives it a best-in-class 2-tonne towing limit, meaning it 
delivers all the grunt you need. 
</p>
<p>
And it was the design of the Korando 4x4 that instantly appealed to Melinda. 
</p>
<p>
She said: &#8220;The Korando looks really good, it&#8217;s not too flashy and the styling 
won&#8217;t date, which is important. And it doesn&#8216;t look like a big bulky 4x4.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
But with three kids, Morgan, 12, Flynn, 11, and nine-year-old Evie, 
practicality, functionality and comfort are priorities. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;The Korando has lots of room, there&#8217;s bags of stowage spaces and a big boot 
for carrying all the family clutter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
And Melinda liked how well-equipped the Korando was with sat/nav and air con, 
and touches of luxury such as the heated front and rear seats, particularly 
useful on the school run on cold winter mornings. 
</p>
<p>
Melinda was also a big fan of the 4x4 system, as she lives in the countryside 
and it snowed for most of her time with the Korando. 
</p>
<p>
She said: &#8220;It was faultless in the snow and for a 4x4 it&#8217;s very easy and 
relaxing to drive &#8211; you sit high up &#8211; and the fuel economy was very good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
So would Melinda recommend the Korando? 
</p>
<p>
She said: &#8220;I think it&#8217;s very much the type of car people are looking for in 
the current economic climate, where value for money is so important. I&#8217;d buy 
one. 
</p>
<p>
The Korando is a vehicle that does the job and it&#8217;s very family friendly, it 
ticks all the boxes and the kids loved it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Now, you have read all about it, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/fun/competitions/article4794032.ece">here's
